# pinecall

The CLI for [Pinecall](https://pinecall.io) agents: link a project to your org, print the prompt a
state produces, chat with the agent in a terminal, run its goldens, and start the process that
answers its calls — for an agent written in TypeScript
([`@pinecall/agents`](https://github.com/pinecall/agents)) or Ruby
([`pinecall` gem](https://github.com/pinecall/ruby)).

## Install

```bash
npm i -g pinecall                 # once per machine, whatever the agent is written in
```

The CLI never loads your class. It starts your project's own serve entry — `@pinecall/agents/serve`
for TypeScript, `Pinecall::Serve` for Ruby, `python -m pinecall.serve` for Python — and drives it
through the gateway, so the SDK that runs is the version your project pinned. A project depends on
its SDK, never on this CLI.

## Quick start

```bash
pinecall new front-desk          # or --ruby, --python: a project of one agent, ready for every verb below
cd front-desk && npm install     # bundle install for Ruby, uv sync for Python
pinecall link        # sign in through the browser; writes your key to ./.env
pinecall prompt      # the prompt the model reads, offline; --state <golden> for another state
pinecall chat        # talk to the agent in this terminal
pinecall test        # run the goldens
pinecall start       # run the agent: the process you deploy
pinecall deploy      # or let Pinecall run it
pinecall mcp install # or do all of it from Claude Code, Codex, Cursor…
```

Every verb acts in the sandbox unless `--prod` is given. The CLI reads `PINECALL_KEY` and
`PINECALL_URL` from the environment or the project's `.env`.

## Development

```bash
pnpm install         # links ../agents, the framework's checkout, when its version fits
pnpm test
pnpm lint
scripts/check        # build, lint, test — what CI runs
```
