# Calls, and what they run on

Part of [the MCP server](../the-mcp.md): every tool of this stage, what each parameter takes — read off the
tool's own schema, as the assistant sees it — and one real call, answered by Pinecall Cloud.

## `calls`

The agent's newest calls: each one's id, channel, length, how it ended, its cost and its verdicts.

`calls` lists the agent's newest calls with their ids; `call` reads one whole.

| parameter | takes | | what it is |
|---|---|---|---|
| `agent` | text |  | the agent's name; the project's only agent when left out |
| `limit` | a whole number 1–100 |  | how many, newest first; 20 when left out |
| `prod` | true or false |  | act in production instead of the sandbox; the org's own switch decides whether this key may |

```json title="called with"

  "limit": 2

  ]
}
```

## `call`

One call's log, entry by entry — every turn, tool call, result, state change, metric and verdict — a page at a time.

`call` reads one call's log the way the runtime keeps it: every entry with its seq, quiet ones included — the turns, each tool call and its result, the state after it, the latency of each turn, the cost, and the verdicts at hang-up (`call.score`). Page with `after`.

| parameter | takes | | what it is |
|---|---|---|---|
| `call` | text | required | the call's id |
| `after` | a whole number 0 or more |  | only entries after this seq: the `next` of the page before |
| `limit` | a whole number 1–500 |  | entries in this page; 200 when left out |
| `types` | a list of texts |  | only these entry types, such as turn.agent or call.score |
| `prod` | true or false |  | act in production instead of the sandbox; the org's own switch decides whether this key may |

## `pipeline`

What the agent hears, decides and speaks with — the vendors and models of each stage — and the latency each measured.

`pipeline` reads the three stages a call runs on (ears, model, voice), which vendor and model each is, and the medians the agent's recent calls measured.

|---|---|---|---|
| `agent` | text |  | the agent's name; the project's only agent when left out |
| `prod` | true or false |  | act in production instead of the sandbox; the org's own switch decides whether this key may |

## `providers`

The vendors an agent may run on: what each does, whether it is ready, and whose key it would run on. Never a key.

`providers` lists every speech, model and voice vendor this gateway can run, what each does, and whose key a call would use. Bringing a key of your own is never a tool: the person types `pinecall providers add <vendor>` in a terminal, or uses the console.

## `telemetry`

Where the org sends its calls' traces: its own OpenTelemetry collector, shown or cleared. Setting one is the person's, in a terminal: the headers are a credential.

`telemetry` reads where this org exports a copy of every spoken call's spans (OTLP; a chat has none: the model's requests, speech in and out, every tool, each span carrying pinecall.org, pinecall.env, pinecall.agent and pinecall.call) and can stop it. Pointing it somewhere is never a tool, since the collector's headers are a credential: the person types `pinecall telemetry set <url> --header <name>` in a terminal, where each value is read off stdin.

| parameter | takes | | what it is |
|---|---|---|---|
| `action` | `show` · `clear` | required | show says where traces go and which headers are set, never their values; clear stops the export |

```json title="called with"
{
  "action": "show"
}
```

```json title="answered"
{
  "collector": {
    "endpoint": "https://otel.example.com/v1/traces",
    "header_names": [
      "x-api-key"
    ],
    "pii": false
  }
}
```

## `monitors`

The numbers the org watches over a window — latency, the judges' held rate, escalations, tool failures, spend, calls — and the line each must not cross; list them, add one, forget one.

`monitors list` says what the org watches in the world — each monitor's rule, who set it, the last day it fired and the value that crossed. `add` watches one number of the observability series (the same the console's Observability screen draws) over 1, 7 or 30 days, for every agent or one, and fires once a day as `monitor.fired` on the agent's log the first time a call's seal finds it on the wrong side of the line. `rm` forgets one. Use it when the person asks to be told when latency, the judges, escalations, tool failures, spend or volume slip.

| parameter | takes | | what it is |
|---|---|---|---|
| `action` | `list` · `add` · `rm` | required | list says every monitor with the last day it fired; add watches a number; rm forgets one by id |
| `name` | text |  | add: the monitor's name, as the alert will read |
| `metric` | `e2e_median_s` · `llm_median_s` · `held_rate` · `escalated_rate` · `tool_failure_rate` · `spend_usd` · `calls` |  | add: the number watched; the rates are shares from 0 to 1, the latencies seconds at the median, spend dollars |
| `above` | true or false |  | add: true fires when the number is over the line, false when it is under (a held_rate floor) |
| `threshold` | a number |  | add: the line |
| `window_days` | `1` or `7` or `30` |  | add: the days the number is read over; 7 when left out |
| `agent` | text |  | add: one agent's calls alone; every agent's when left out |
| `id` | text |  | rm: the monitor's id, from list |
| `prod` | true or false |  | act in production instead of the sandbox; the org's own switch decides whether this key may |

```json title="called with"
{
  "action": "add",
  "name": "slow answers",

      "fired_on": "2026-10-08",
      "fired_value": 2.41
    }
  ]
}
```

## `webhook`

Where the org posts its alerts — a monitor fired, the spend unusual, a quota out — shown, proven with a signed test post, or cleared. Setting one is the person's, in a terminal: the secret is a credential.

`webhook` reads where this org's alerts are posted beyond the agent's log ({type, org, env, agent, at, data}, with x-pinecall-event and, when a secret is set, x-pinecall-signature as sha256=<HMAC-SHA256 of the body>), proves the URL with a test post, and can stop it. Pointing it somewhere is never a tool, since the secret is a credential: the person types `pinecall webhook set <url> --secret` in a terminal, where the secret is read off stdin. The bell in the console is each person's own choice, under Notifications.

| parameter | takes | | what it is |
|---|---|---|---|
| `action` | `show` · `test` · `clear` | required | show says the URL and whether posts are signed; test posts one webhook.test event and says whether the URL answered 2xx; clear stops the posting |
