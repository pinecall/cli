# Getting started

Part of [the MCP server](../the-mcp.md): every tool of this stage, what each parameter takes — read off the
tool's own schema, as the assistant sees it — and one real call, answered by Pinecall Cloud.

## `whoami`

Which org, gateway and environment the open project's key acts in, and whether production is allowed.

`whoami` first, in any session: it proves the project's key and names the org. Refused with a sentence naming `link` when the project has no key yet; with `prod`, it says whether the key may act in production.

| parameter | takes | | what it is |
|---|---|---|---|
| `prod` | true or false |  | act in production instead of the sandbox; the org's own switch decides whether this key may |

```json title="called with"
{}
```

```json title="answered"
{
  "org": "acme",
  "gateway": "https://cloud.pinecall.io",
  "environment": "sandbox",
  "key_from": ".env",
  "person": "Ana",
  "production_allowed_for_this_key": true,
  "production_allowed_for_this_server": false
}
```

## `login`

Sign this machine in to Pinecall: `start` returns a link for the person to open; `status` waits for their approval.

`login` signs this machine in, once: `start` answers a link — show it to the person, who signs in there, in a browser, where a password belongs — then call `status` until it says signed in. No password and no key ever passes through you. Then `link` writes the project's key.

| parameter | takes | | what it is |
|---|---|---|---|
| `action` | `start` · `status` | required | start opens a sign-in and answers its link; status waits for the person to approve it |
| `gateway` | text |  | the gateway to sign in to; Pinecall Cloud when left out |
| `wait_s` | a whole number 0–50 |  | how long to wait before answering what is known so far, in seconds; 25 when left out |

```json title="called with"
{
  "action": "status",
  "wait_s": 0
}
```

```json title="answered"
{
  "signed_in": false,
  "says": "nothing in flight: call login with action start"
}
```

## `link`

List the person's orgs (`orgs`), or write the key of one of them into the open project's .env (`write`).

`link` ties the open project to an org, once a machine is signed in (`login`): `orgs` lists them, `write` mints the person's key in the chosen one and writes it into the project's .env, which every other tool reads. The key itself never comes back to you.

| parameter | takes | | what it is |
|---|---|---|---|
| `action` | `orgs` · `write` | required | orgs lists the person's orgs; write mints their key in one and writes it into the project's .env |
| `org` | text |  | the org's slug, for `write`; may be left out when the person has one org |

```json title="called with"
{
  "action": "orgs"
}
```

```json title="answered"
{
  "orgs": [
    {
      "slug": "acme",
      "this_machines": true
    },
    {
      "slug": "acme-staging",
      "this_machines": false
    },
    {
      "slug": "northwind",
      "this_machines": false
    }
  ]
}
```

## `project`

The project the tools act on (`show`), another folder opened (`open`), a new project of one agent written (`new`), or one more agent or golden in it (`generate`).

`project show` says which folder every tool acts on: its agents, their language, and whether it has a key. The host's declared root, or the server's folder, is used when it holds `agents/`; `open` points at another, with nothing held. `new` writes a project of one agent (a receptionist that takes a message, its test and one golden) and opens it; a TypeScript one runs at once on the framework this server lends it until `npm install` pins its own, a Ruby one after `bundle install`, a Python one after `uv sync`. `generate` adds to the open project, never over a file: `agent` a second agent from the same templates (its class, its test, one golden), `golden` a conversation in `test/<agent>/goldens/` from the caller's lines and the tools that must be called — then `test run` holds the agent to it.

| parameter | takes | | what it is |
|---|---|---|---|
| `action` | `show` · `open` · `new` · `generate` | required | show the project the tools act on; open another folder; new writes a project of one agent; generate adds an agent or a golden to it |
| `path` | text |  | `open`: the project's folder; `new`: the folder to write it in, beside the open project when left out |
| `name` | text |  | `new` and `generate`: the agent's or the golden's name: lowercase letters, digits and dashes |
| `language` | `typescript` · `ruby` · `python` |  | `new` and `generate agent`: the agent's language; TypeScript for `new`, the project's for `generate` |
| `kind` | `agent` · `golden` |  | `generate`: one more agent, or one more golden of an agent |
| `input` | a list of texts |  | `generate golden`: what the caller says, one line each, in order |
| `tools` | a list of texts |  | `generate golden`: the tools that must be called |
| `agent` | text |  | `generate golden`: whose golden; the project's only agent when left out |
