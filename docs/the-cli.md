# The CLI

`pinecall <group> [args]`. Every verb, what it is for, what it takes, and what it prints. The endpoints
underneath are the gateway API — the **runtime** repo's `docs/protocol/gateway-api.md` — and this
CLI is a client of that contract and of nothing else, so anything here is something your own code
can do too. Which environment a verb acts in, and what is yours against what is the org's, is one page:
[environments-and-teams.md](https://github.com/pinecall/agents/blob/main/docs/worlds-and-teams.md).

One module per group, imported only when it is asked for: `pinecall prompt` must not pay for a
websocket client. `pinecall` with nothing after it prints the whole CLI on one screen, built verbs
and planned ones alike; `pinecall <group> --help` prints that group's flags, after a subverb too
(`pinecall memory policy --help`); and `pinecall --version` (`-v`) prints the version installed.

```bash
npm i -g pinecall                 # the CLI, once per machine, for every language
pinecall start                    # in the project's directory: the process you deploy
```

The CLI never loads the framework. A TypeScript agent is served by the project's own
`@pinecall/agents` — the version it pinned, found from the project's root — and a project without
it is refused by name; a Ruby agent by the `pinecall` gem, a Python agent by the `pinecall` package
in the project's own `.venv`.

In a checkout the CLI runs from source through tsx (`bin/pinecall.js`); what npm installs is the
compiled `dist/index.js` and needs no loader.

Running the gateway yourself, from nothing? The runtime repo's `docs/from-zero.md` is that
path end to end, with every output under it.

| [`chat`](#chat) | the same app in this terminal, and a written caller against it | yes |
| [`prompt`](#prompt) | the exact prompt a state would produce, offline | **no** |

| [`line`](#line) | which phone is yours, and whose terminal a call from anybody else's rings in | yes |
| [`numbers`](#numbers) | which number reaches which agent, in the environment it answers in, and which the org's accounts own free | yes |

| [`callbacks`](#callbacks) | the numbers people left when every seat was taken | yes |
| [`data`](#data) | the org's data: erasures and their trail, its policy, consent, the do-not-call list, export | yes |
| [`deploy`](#deploy) | this project run by the platform itself: uploaded as a release, installed and started there; list, releases, rollback, logs, stop, start, rm | yes |
| [`secrets`](#secrets) | the values the org's hosted apps are started with: list, set, rm — never read back | yes |
| [`login`](#login) | sign this machine in through a browser; `link` asks for it when it is needed | yes |
| [`whoami`](#whoami) | which gateway, which org, which environments the key opens, and where the key came from | yes |
| [`mcp`](#mcp) | the MCP server an assistant runs this CLI as; `mcp install` adds it to every assistant here | the tools do |

`--prod` is no verb's and every verb's: anywhere on the line, it runs that one command in
production ([below](#where-the-gateway-and-the-key-come-from)) — and a verb that asks no gateway
anything, `prompt`, refuses it instead of accepting an environment it never visits.

Declared and not written: `observe`, `costs`, `call`, `tokens`. Typing one prints `<verb> is not built yet: <what it is for>` and exits 0 — a person who types a verb deserves
better than "unknown command". `src/groups.ts` is the one place that says which half of the
CLI is still a design, and a verb leaves that table in the commit that writes it.

---

## Where the gateway and the key come from

**The project's, the way any app reads its own secrets** (`src/env.ts`). Every verb reads
`PINECALL_KEY` and `PINECALL_URL` from the process's environment — a server's secrets, a CI job's
— else from the nearest `.env` walking up from the directory it runs in, which
[`pinecall link`](#link) wrote. `PINECALL_URL` is `https://cloud.pinecall.io` unless one of the two
names another. Nothing else is read: v1's `PINECALL_API_KEY` never is, because a shell that still
had v1's key exported once pointed every verb at another org with every line reading the same.

**A project folder is one org.** `pinecall link` in the folder writes your key for the org you
pick; a project of another org is another folder with its own `.env`, and nothing is ever
switched. There are no profiles, no active mark and no flag that points one command elsewhere.

```console
~/clinica $ pinecall link
  1. clinica
  2. dental-sur
which org is this project? 1
▸ clinica · PINECALL_KEY written to .env
```

**One gateway, two environments, one identity.** Production and the sandbox are two environments of the same
gateway — each with its own data, neither reaching the other — and `PINECALL_URL` is that one
gateway, for both. The environment a request acts in is decided there, from the key and the header,
never from the name: every verb knocks at the same URL with the same key, and says which environment
it means.

| the verb | knocks at | with | saying |
|---|---|---|---|
| without `--prod` — the sandbox | `PINECALL_URL` | the project's key | `pinecall-env: sandbox` |
| with `--prod` | `PINECALL_URL` | the project's key | `pinecall-env: production` |

**A person's key opens both environments.** Nothing is derived, minted or discovered for the sandbox:
the key `pinecall link` wrote is the one every verb sends, and the `pinecall-env` header on every
request and every socket (`@pinecall/agents/client`'s `signed.ts`) says which environment it acts in — absent, the
gateway takes the sandbox. `--prod` is for one command and keeps nothing, so the next command is
in the sandbox again. Production lets a person through only while their production switch is on —
an admin's always is — and otherwise answers `403 <name> has no production access: an admin gives
it in Team`.

```console
~/clinica $ pinecall sessions            # your sandbox calls
~/clinica $ pinecall sessions --prod     # production's, at the same gateway
~/clinica $ pinecall agent set --voice carolina --note "warmer" --prod
```

**A server's token** is the other kind of key: the org's, made in the console's Tokens screen of
the environment it is for, and put in the server's secrets as `PINECALL_KEY`. It acts in its own environment
alone, and the header may only agree. A sandbox token (`pc_test_`) is caught before it knocks:
``this PINECALL_KEY is a sandbox server's token, made at <url>: run the verb without --prod``. A
production token starts `pc_live_` like a person's key, so the CLI cannot tell the two apart: a
production token sent without `--prod` is refused by the gateway, in its words (``this key is a
production server's token, and this request is for sandbox: a server's token opens the environment it
was made in``). [production.md](https://github.com/pinecall/agents/blob/main/docs/production.md) is that path.

`whoami` and `callbacks` open by printing where they went: `gateway <url> · key from <where> ·
<environment>`. The rest get on with the answer. With no key anywhere every one of them is refused:
``no PINECALL_KEY here: `pinecall link` in the project's folder writes it to .env (a server keeps
it in its secrets)``, and the exit code is 2. **`pinecall whoami` is the first thing to run when an
endpoint refuses you and will not say why.**

## `~/.pinecall/`

| file | what it holds |
|---|---|
| `session.json` | `{ "gateways": { "<url>": { key?, calling? } }, "last": … }` — this machine, one row per gateway it knows (`src/signed-in.ts`): `key`, this machine signed in as a person (`login`), which `link` mints a project's key from; `calling`, the phone `pinecall line from` said, re-sent by every `start`. No project reads it for its own key: that is the `.env` |

The directory is `0700` and the file `0600`; `PINECALL_HOME` moves it. A key is never printed,
never logged, and never put in a URL. A `.env` that `link` creates is `0600` too.

---

# Writing the agent

## The project

One layout, whether the repository holds one agent or five. Every folder a verb reads is under the
project's root, by the agent's name (`src/home.ts`):

```
agents/<name>/agent.tsx          the class — and beside it only what this agent uses (callbacks.ts);
                                 agent.ts, agent.rb or agent.py for a class in another language
lib/                             what two or more agents share
test/<name>/agent.test.ts        unit tests: the class as software
test/<name>/goldens/             goldens: the conversations `test` runs; beside them `docs.json`,
                                 the questions `docs eval` asks the base, and `memory.json`,
                                 the questions `memory eval` asks recall
test/<name>/memory/              the extraction cases `remember` runs
```

**The agent's slug is its folder's name.** `agents/sales/agent.tsx` is the agent `sales` on the
gateway — its settings, its numbers, its callers and judges — whatever its class is called. A class
whose `static slug` says another is refused when it is served, naming both: rename the folder.

**The business is not in the repository.** What the agent knows by heart — hours, prices, what
needs an authorisation — is one field of its settings, per environment and corner, written in the
console's Configure ▸ General (its Knowledge section) or with [`pinecall agent knowledge edit`](#agent-knowledge), and
read whole into the prompt on every call. Nor are the documents a turn searches: they are a base,
written in the console's Knowledge ▸ Docs, and a local `docs/<name>/` is only what `docs push` sends
when no directory is named. A class
that still carries a voice, a model, an opening, a memory policy, a knowledge file or a base is
refused at load, and the refusal names the verb that sets it now
([writing-an-agent.md](https://github.com/pinecall/agents/blob/main/docs/writing-an-agent.md)).

At the root, every verb that reads a class acts on **every agent**, each against its own folders,
or on the one `--agent <name>` names — by its folder's name, which is its slug (`sales`):

| at the root | does |
|---|---|
| `pinecall start` | every agent at once, **in one process of their language**; each line prefixed by the slug, one console URL each. `--show-prompt` prints every agent's prompt under its slug |
| `pinecall test` | each agent's goldens through its own class, one after another; the exit code is the worst. Paths and `--watch` are for one agent, so they need `--agent` |
| `pinecall docs push` · `eval` | every agent that has `docs/<name>/` · `test/<name>/goldens/docs.json`; the rest are named and skipped |
| `pinecall personas` | every verb, since a caller is one agent's: `--agent <name>` when the project holds several |
| `pinecall chat` · `simulate` · `prompt` · `remember` · `memory eval` · `line` · `start --ui` | one agent: `--agent <name>` is required when there are several |
| `pinecall judges` | one agent's own judges: `--agent <name>` when the project holds several |

A project of several with nobody named is refused with the names: `chat talks to one agent and
this project has 2: add --agent dispatch or --agent sales`. A directory with no `agents/` at all is one somebody
typed the verb in by mistake, and the refusal says where it looked. A folder the verb reads and
nobody has written yet is empty, not an error: an agent with no `goldens/` has no goldens, the
console's roster says so, and `pinecall test` names the folder to write one in.

`--agent` means two things, one per kind of verb. In a verb that reads a class it names an agent
of this project, by its folder's name. In a verb that only asks the gateway — `sessions`, `pipeline`,
`runs drift`, `numbers import`, `callbacks`, `docs attach` — it is a slug, because there is no
class to find. `--file` is always a file.

## `new`

```
pinecall new <name> [--typescript | --ruby | --python]
```

A project of one agent in `./<name>/`, in the layout every verb reads: the class under
`agents/<name>/` — a receptionist that answers from the documents it is given and otherwise takes a
message with one tool — its ring-0 test, one golden under `test/<name>/goldens/`, a `.gitignore`
that keeps `.env` and `.pinecall/` out, and the toolchain: `package.json`, `tsconfig.json` and
`vitest.config.ts` for TypeScript (the default), a `Gemfile` and a `Rakefile` for `--ruby`, with
the view in `agents/<name>/views/<name>.erb`, a `pyproject.toml` for `--python` (uv, pytest), with
the view in `agents/<name>/views/<name>.jinja`. A project depends on its language's SDK and on
nothing else: `@pinecall/agents` at the version this CLI is released with, the `pinecall` gem, or
the `pinecall` package. The CLI is never a dependency of the project.

The name is the agent's slug — lowercase letters, digits and dashes, starting with a letter — and
the folder must not exist or must be empty. It writes files and nothing else: no key, no install,
no gateway. It prints the commands that come next.

```console
$ pinecall new front-desk --ruby
▸ front-desk · a Ruby agent

  cd front-desk
  bundle install
  pinecall link        sign in, pick the org: its key goes to .env
  pinecall chat        talk to it here
  pinecall test        its goldens, against a real model
  pinecall start       answer calls
```

## `generate`

```
pinecall generate agent <name> [--typescript | --ruby | --python]
pinecall generate golden <name> --input '…' [--input '…']… [--tool <name>]… [--agent <name>]
```

`g` for short. Run at the project's root; it writes files and nothing else, and never over a file
that is there.

`agent` adds a second agent beside the first, from the templates `new` writes: its class under
`agents/<name>/`, its ring-0 test under `test/<name>/` and one golden. It is written in the project's
language unless `--typescript`, `--ruby` or `--python` says otherwise. At the root, `pinecall start` then
holds every agent, and a verb about one takes `--agent`.

`golden` writes `test/<agent>/goldens/<name>.json`: the caller's lines, one `--input` each in
order, and the tools that must be called (`--tool`). Every golden is judged by `consent` and
`heard`; the other expectations — `says`, `not`, `grounded`, `register` — are added to its
`expect` by hand. `--agent` names the agent when the project has several.

```console
$ pinecall g golden asks-for-a-refund --input "Hi, I want a refund." --input "It's Ana Ruiz." --tool takeMessage
  wrote test/front-desk/goldens/asks-for-a-refund.json
```

A golden from a call that already happened is `pinecall runs promote <call>`; a simulated caller is
`pinecall personas add`, kept by the gateway, not a file.

---

## `start`

```
pinecall start [agent.tsx] [--agent <name>] [--prod] [--ui] [--events] [--show-prompt]
               [--inspect[=host:port] | --inspect-brk]
```

At a project's root with no file named, every `agents/<name>/agent.tsx` is held at once, in one
process: see [The project](#the-project). They must be in one language, as one process serves
them; a project with a Ruby agent and a TypeScript one is told to name one with `--agent`.

**Two processes, two sockets.** `start` never loads your class. It starts the agent's language's
serve entry — the project's `@pinecall/agents/serve` for TypeScript, `Pinecall::Serve` for Ruby, through bundler when
the project has a `Gemfile`, `python -m pinecall.serve` for Python, with the project's `.venv/bin/python` when it
has one and `python3` when not — which holds the agents and serves their calls, and it watches that
process: its lines are what `start` prints. Beside it, `start` holds a socket of its own that
takes no call and answers the console's screens (`answers_dev`); the panel beside a conversation is
drawn by the class's process. `pinecall agent list` shows both, the second named
`pinecall-cli/<version>`. `--inspect` opens the agent's process to a debugger.

The app registered on the gateway and answering: **this is the process you deploy**, the same one
on a laptop and on a server. With nothing said it holds the **sandbox** agent — at `PINECALL_URL`,
with the project's key, saying `pinecall-env: sandbox` ([above](#where-the-gateway-and-the-key-come-from)) — and in the sandbox
**the agent is held per person**: two developers of one tenant each run the same agent and each
reaches their own, while a *number* is one endpoint and rings in one place — a developer's own phone
reaches their copy, and anybody else's call lands where the line was claimed ([`line`](#line)). An
admin, and whoever runs the gateway, see every corner of the sandbox rather than only their own.

**`--prod` runs production's agent**, the one the org's customers reach, at `PINECALL_URL`. On a
server that is a production server's token in `PINECALL_KEY`, which was made for it and is
refused without the flag; on a person's key it opens only while their production switch is on,
and the gateway's refusal is printed before anything registers. How a server runs it — under the process manager, or
inside your own Node app — is [production.md](https://github.com/pinecall/agents/blob/main/docs/production.md).

It binds no port and serves no page. One line per log entry on stdout, and under the connected
line where its console is — **and there are two consoles, one per environment**, both served by the one
gateway: the sandbox's under `/sandbox`, production's at the root. In the sandbox the line reads
`console  https://cloud.pinecall.io/sandbox/a/clinica-norte?login=lc_…` and in production
`console  https://cloud.pinecall.io/a/clinica-norte?login=lc_…`: a one-use code the gateway minted in
that environment for the key this process holds, dead in five minutes, which the page spends for a key
of its own and never sees this process's. **Only in a terminal**: when stdout is not one —
pm2, systemd, a container, a hosted app — the line is the console's address with no code
(`console  https://cloud.pinecall.io/a/clinica-norte`) and none is minted, because that output is a log
somebody else reads later. Opening a console without one asks for an email, a password, and the org
only when the person belongs to several.

In the sandbox, every time the socket comes up — the first connect and each reconnect, in every
mode — `start` re-sends the phone `pinecall line from` kept for the sandbox, whatever agents it
holds — no class declares a number, so there is no way to tell from here which agent has one. The gateway keeps that phone only beside its live table, so a gateway that
restarted learns it back at once instead of sending your test call to production. A gateway that
goes away is one line — `gateway  … — reconnecting`, then `gateway  back` — and never a stack per
redial.

**A signal drains before it leaves.** `SIGTERM` (a deploy) or `SIGINT` (Ctrl-C, or `q` in `--ui`)
is passed to the agent's process once, which sends `agent.drain` for every agent: the gateway hands
the live calls to another process holding the agent, or keeps them for the next one that
registers, and the tools running now are let finish, up to 30 s. One line on stderr says what
happened — `draining · 1 live call kept for the next process · 1 tool finished` — and then both
processes exit. A second signal kills the agent's process at once, and so does one it has not left
by in 40 s. If `start` itself is killed, the agent's process sees its stdin close and drains on its
own. Give it that long under its manager ([production.md](https://github.com/pinecall/agents/blob/main/docs/production.md#a-deploy)).

```console
$ pinecall start

```

| flag | |
|---|---|
| `--prod` | production's agent, at `PINECALL_URL`: a production server's token, or a person's key while their switch is on |
| `--ui` | the full-screen terminal view. `p` pause · `c` clear · `e` events · `q` quit. The prompt a call is in is not on screen: the gateway keeps a hash of each block, not its text — `pinecall prompt` prints the page a state produces |
| `--events` | the agent's process's own lines: one JSON object per wire entry, `{"type","agent","call","data"}` with `data` as the gateway wrote it (snake_case), `agent.registered` first, for a pipe |
| `--show-prompt` | the prompt a fresh instance would produce, through the agent's serve entry, then exit. No key, no gateway |
| `--inspect` · `--inspect-brk` | Node's own flag, given to the agent's process; a Ruby or Python agent runs no Node and is refused it |

**It answers the console for this directory.** What a screen needs of the agent's directory — a
written call to the agent here, a simulation, the goldens and a suite, the
documents pushed and their golden asked, the memory goldens, a call promoted to a candidate,
the drift, a reproduction a broken run left — the console asks the gateway, and the gateway asks
THIS process over its companion socket (`dev.request` → `dev.answer`; the runtime's
`docs/protocol/dev-verbs.md`), which reaches the agent's process by its app id when a call is
needed. The lines those verbs print land here, as if you had typed them.
A `pinecall start` in another agent's directory answers `simulate` with a sentence saying so.

## `console`

```
pinecall console [agent] [--prod] [--no-open]
```

**The console of this project's environment, in a browser, signed in.** The one gateway serves both
consoles at its one name: production's at `<url>/`, the **sandbox's** at `<url>/sandbox/` — the
same origin, the same sign-in. This verb opens the sandbox's — your copies of the agents, their
calls as they happen, chat, evals and their suites, docs, memory, the widget and its preview, and
how to reach your copy by phone — and `--prod` opens production's, if your org lets you act there.

```console
$ pinecall console
console  https://cloud.pinecall.io/sandbox/?login=lc_9f2   (opens within five minutes, once)
```

**The key never travels.** The gateway mints a one-use code standing for this terminal's key, in
the environment the verb acts in — five minutes, one use — and the page spends the code for a key of
that browser's own, which is revoked on its own from Tokens. Name an agent
(`pinecall console clinica-norte`) and it opens that agent's screens instead of the org's floor. A
machine with no browser prints the URL, and `--no-open` says not to try. A server's token signs no
browser in: it names no person, and the gateway says so.

One sign-in opens both consoles, because they are one origin: the chip in the top bar switches
between `/` and `/sandbox/`, and the page tells the environment it is in from its path.

Which screens each console has is one table in the console's source
(the console's `src/console/lib/mode.ts`): running the org — numbers, tokens, providers, the team, usage —
and the platform's own screens are production's; **Dev chat**, running a suite and **Phone testing** are
the sandbox's; Home, Overview, Live, Sessions, **Personas**, **Simulations**, Evals, Memory, Docs
and every tab of an agent, its Lexicon among them, are both's. An admin opens a colleague's copy from the sandbox's
console, never from production's, which has no corners
([environments-and-teams.md](https://github.com/pinecall/agents/blob/main/docs/worlds-and-teams.md)).

**The header picks an environment only for a person.** A server's token acts in the environment its prefix
names, and a header saying the other is refused; a person's key acts where `pinecall-env` says —
the sandbox when it says nothing — and in production only while their switch is on.

## `line`

```
pinecall line [from <+number> | forget | claim | release] [agent.tsx] [--agent <name>]
```

**A number rings in one place, and a team shares its numbers.** With one developer that is not a
decision: the first `pinecall start` to hold the agent answers its ring and you never learn the word.
With three it used to be whoever restarted last — so you would dial the number to test your change
and be answered in a colleague's scrollback, with nothing on either screen saying so.

**Say which phone is yours, once.** Then every call you make lands in your own agent: no claim, no
coordination, three of you testing at the same time.

**It works on the production number, and that is the usual case.** A call from your phone to a
number that answers in production reaches your sandbox copy while you are holding that agent — your
class, your tools, your terminal, a sandbox log marked `diverted_from: production` — and every other
caller reaches production exactly as before. Stop `pinecall start`, or `pinecall line forget`, and
your own calls go back to production. That is how a team tests on the line its customers use, with
one number: a sandbox number is optional, and when an org has one, your phone reaches your copy
there too. The gateway's worker asks for this on every production ring
(`GET /v1/agents/{slug}/rings-for`), so nothing here knocks at that endpoint.

```console
$ pinecall line from +59899111111
calls from +59899111111 reach this terminal
```

A phone is a **person's** and not an agent's, so it works in whatever directory you are standing
in and on every agent you hold. It is said in the sandbox and kept under the gateway's URL (`calling`
in `~/.pinecall/session.json`) and re-sent by every `pinecall start` when it starts — the gateway keeps
it beside its live table and not in a row, because it is only meaningful next to a socket: a
developer running nothing has no corner for a call to land in. `forget` undoes it. `claim`,
`release` and the bare `line` are about one agent: at a project's root with several, name it with
`--agent`. The **gateway** refuses a number that is not in E.164 form, with the shape in the
sentence, and refuses an org's own key outright: it names nobody, so there is no *their own agent*
to reach. Nothing is checked in the terminal first — what you see is what the gateway answered.

**And for a call from a number nobody said was theirs** — a customer, a colleague's phone — there
is the **line**:

```console
$ pinecall line
rings in berna@clinica.test · `pinecall line from <+your-number>` routes yours, or `claim` takes it

$ pinecall line claim
rings in this terminal · also running: berna@clinica.test
```

`release` gives it up, and whoever else is still running the agent picks it up — which is also
what happens on its own when the terminal holding it closes. A claim on an agent this terminal is
not running is refused: a ring lands on the line, so a corner with no app in it would take the
call and drop it. Production has one corner and the platform holds it, so there is nothing to claim
there — only your own phone is diverted, as above; `pinecall start` prints the line only for an
agent that declares a number.

## `chat`

```
pinecall chat [agent] [--agent <name>] [--file agent.tsx] [--prod] [--as <contact>]
             [--state file [--case n]] [--events] [--inspect[=host:port] | --inspect-brk]
```

With nothing after it: the agent of this directory, served by a process this terminal starts —
the agent's own language's serve entry, which takes no call it did not open — and a written
caller against it in the same terminal. This is `rails console`: the tools run on this machine,
and `--inspect` or `--inspect-brk` opens that process to a debugger, so a breakpoint in a `@tool`
is reachable (a TypeScript agent's; a Ruby or Python agent runs no Node, and the flag is refused). It works
with no `pinecall start` up and with three of them, because the caller socket names that process.
Leaving the chat stops it.

A written call runs in the gateway, so a gateway that restarts drops the socket — and keeps the
call. `chat` says `the gateway went away — the call is kept, reconnecting…`, dials again naming
the call, and the conversation goes on, history and state whole. It gives up after about a minute.

When the input ends — Ctrl-D, or the end of a pipe — `chat` hangs up once the agent has answered
every line it was sent, one turn at a time (a minute at most). It hangs up through the gateway,
which ends the call before it closes the socket, so the agent's process stops with nothing live: `printf 'hello\n' | pinecall chat` prints the answer and leaves a
call that ended `caller_hung_up`, never one left open.

```console
$ pinecall chat --as +34600000001
‹ hi, I'd like to change my Thursday appointment
› Of course. Could I have your full name and phone number?

$ pinecall chat clinica-norte
```

**The positional is an agent's slug, never a file.** Named one, `chat` starts nothing and is only
the caller's side: a written call at whatever is already holding that slug — your own `pinecall
start` in the other terminal, or a colleague's, in the corner your key reaches. `--file` is how you
name the class to serve by its path, and it is the same word in every verb that loads a file
(`test`, `simulate`, `remember`, `personas`, `docs`, `memory`); `--agent` names one agent of a
project of several, by its folder's name, and is required there because a chat talks to one.

`--as` is who is calling — the id memory files the call under. `--state file [--case n]` opens the
call in a state: the same goldens file `prompt` reads. It rides the call's socket (`?state=`) and
the gateway puts it on the call's `call.started`, so it opens a call in a colleague's agent too. `--events` prints the wire instead. `--prod` talks to production's
agent, while your org lets you act there; nothing said is the sandbox.

## `prompt`

```
pinecall prompt [agent.tsx] [--state <file>] [--case n] [--agent <name>]
                [--channel phone|web|whatsapp] [--medium voice|text]
```

The exact prompt a state would produce, offline: **no gateway, no key, no call**. The three
regions in the order the model receives them, then the stage and the tools that stage shows. The
verb you run while writing a `render()`, and it answers in the time it takes to save the file. The
CLI reads the goldens file and hands the case's state, field by field, to the agent's own serve
entry, which loads the class and prints the page. Without `--state` the page is the one a call
opens on: the class's own defaults, before any tool has run.
Because it asks nobody anything, `--prod` is refused here rather than taken and ignored.

The page is a phone call's unless `--channel` and `--medium` name another, and they change what a
call on that line would change: the `<channel>` block at the end of `identity`
([the-prompt.md](https://github.com/pinecall/agents/blob/main/docs/the-prompt.md)), and whatever a `render()` says on `this.call.channel` or
`this.call.medium`. Without `--medium` the call has the one its channel implies — `whatsapp` is
`text`, `phone` and `web` are `voice` — so `--channel web --medium text` is the page a written chat
on the widget gets.

```console
$ pinecall prompt --state test/clinica-norte/goldens/identifica-al-paciente.json
── identity (static) ──
You are the front desk of Clínica Norte. Formal, short sentences. …

── knowledge (static) ──

# Holding it to something

## `test`

```
pinecall test [paths] [--agent <name>] [--file agent.tsx] [--model m]… [--grep x] [--watch] [--json]
              [--case <name>]… [--dataset] [--version n] [--inspect[=host:port] | --inspect-brk]
pinecall test --voice [--background-noise dB] [--packet-loss 0.05]
```

Every golden of `test/<name>/goldens/` (at a project's root, each agent's own) through
the agent a process **this terminal starts** serves — a console's process, which takes no call the
run did not open, stopped when the run is over — scored by the gateway's judges, printed as a
matrix. Exits 1
when a golden did not hold. One agent with no goldens yet is told where to write one and exits 2;
in a project, an agent with none is named and skipped. Every broken golden is
written whole to `.pinecall/evals/<run>/<golden>.json` — the golden as written, the verdicts, and
**the requests the model answered**, which the log deliberately keeps only a hash of.

```console
$ pinecall test --grep reserva
clinica-norte · 2 goldens · haiku · run_7ed3ace9352d
clinica-norte · 2 goldens · anthropic/claude-haiku-5-5
  ✓ no-reserva-antes-del-si  e2e_latency 2605ms · llm_node_ttft 763ms
  ✓ reserva-cuando-el-paciente-dice-que-si  e2e_latency 1948ms · llm_node_ttft 911ms
  2/2 · 0 judge calls · $0.0250 · 8s
```

`--model vendor/model` repeated is a column of the matrix per model. `--voice` says the same
goldens out loud on a real line; `--background-noise` puts a television behind the caller
at that many dB under them, and `--packet-loss` drops that share of their packets — a fraction
from 0 to 1 here (`0.05` is one in twenty), where `simulate` takes a percent.

**The org's cases play beside the goldens.** A case is a real call kept as a golden by the
gateway ([`cases`](#cases)). `--case <name>`, repeated, plays those cases by name, whatever their
status — a `pending` one too, which is how the call that broke is reproduced before anybody
approves it. `--dataset` plays every case of the agent a person approved that is not held out and
not kept in the repository: what a nightly asks for. With `--case` or `--dataset` and **no
paths**, only the cases are played — `test/<name>/goldens/` is not read, and a project with no
goldens yet is not refused; with paths, both. Cases are a real caller's words, so they play only
in the sandbox (the gateway refuses `--prod`), and `--watch` beside them needs a path to watch:
a run of cases alone reads no file that could change, and is refused with exit 2. In a project of
several agents, `--dataset` plays each agent's in turn; `--case` names one agent's cases and needs
`--agent`.

`--version n` builds every call of the run on that version of the agent's settings — as `agent
history` numbers them — instead of the one standing: a candidate measured against what runs now.

**Whose settings a run plays on is the key's.** From a laptop, a person's key runs on **your
corner** of the sandbox ([`agent`](#agent)); in CI, a sandbox server token runs on **the
team's**. So a settings fix that is only in your corner is green at your desk and red in CI,
until `pinecall agent push --team` (or `agent set … --team`) gives it to the team. `--version`
names a version of the corner the run plays on.

## `simulate`

```
pinecall simulate --persona <name> [--judge] [--turns n (15)] [--voice] [--listen]
                  [--background-noise dB] [--packet-loss 0.05] [--agent <name>] [--file agent.tsx]
                  [--inspect[=host:port] | --inspect-brk]
```

A model in the gateway plays the caller — every turn improvised from the persona's goal, its style
and its own facts, with no script. A process this terminal starts serves the agent (a written
call names it; a spoken one arrives from a worker naming nobody, so for `--voice` that process
takes unclaimed calls), this terminal prints the conversation, the gateway holds the provider keys.

```console
$ pinecall simulate --persona hurried --listen --turns 2
--listen is a call with audio in it: --voice is on
hurried · move the appointment to Tuesday afternoon, giving no more than needed
  listening as sup_edb03d90e627 · ffplay
› Clínica Norte, good morning.  How can I help you?   tts_node_ttfb 127ms
‹ Hi, I need to move my Thursday appointment with Dr. Vidal to Tuesday afternoon.
→ freeSlots({"day":"Tuesday"})
← freeSlots [{"when":"Tuesday at ten","doctor":"Dr. Vidal"},{…
› Here are Tuesday's free slots. …   llm_node_ttft 1681ms  tts_node_ttfb 127ms
  call_6123e7d7deb875e2e9be7686 · 2 caller turn(s) · 3 agent turn(s) · a clean line
```

`--persona` names one of the agent's callers, kept by the gateway — not a file of the project. The model
that plays it is the persona's own `llm` when it set one; with `--judge`, a caller that wrote a
rule adds a `persona` row to the score — `held` when it hung up satisfied, `broken` when it
declined, which is exit 1 like any broken judge.

`--voice` is a real line: a room, the agent dispatched into it, and the caller read out in the
persona's own `tts` and `voice` when it set them — else the platform's default voice vendor and **a
voice from the operator's list for the agent's language that the agent does not have** (English's
when that language has none), so the two sides are told apart by ear. The caller waits for the opening to be said before its first line, as a person does.
`--background-noise` and `--packet-loss` spoil that line on purpose and are refused without it;
`--packet-loss` is the share of the caller's packets that never arrive, from 0 to 1, as `test` takes it.

`--listen` puts the call on **this machine's speakers** while it happens: the same hidden `observe`
seat the console's listen button takes, joined from Node, both tracks mixed onto whichever of
`ffplay`, `play`, `aplay` or `pw-play` you have. It turns `--voice` on and says so, because a
written call has no audio in it. `--judge` reads back the `call.score` the log seals on.

## `personas`

```
pinecall personas [list] | show <name> | try <name>
pinecall personas add <name> --goal '…' --style '…' [--about '…'] [--fact 'what=said']…
pinecall personas edit <name> [--goal '…'] [--style '…'] [--about '…'] [--fact 'what=said']… [--rename <name>]
                … add and edit also take [--llm x] [--tts x] [--voice x] [--accepts-when '…'] [--declines-when '…']
pinecall personas rm <name> · pinecall personas push [--from test/<agent>/personas]
                … any of them with --json, --prod in production, and --agent <name> or
                --file agent.tsx when the project holds more than one agent
```

**The callers are the AGENT's, kept by the gateway** — one list per agent, the same in both environments:
the patient who cancels is the clinic's, and another agent of the org has callers of its own, even
under the same name. So the console shows the same ones this verb does, a caller written here
needs no deploy, and a project holds none of them in its repository.

```console
$ pinecall personas
hurried       short sentences, interrupts, gives just what is asked     move the appointment to Tuesday
suspicious    polite and wary, answers with another question             find out the price of a crown

$ pinecall personas add price-shopper --goal "get a price for a deep clean" \
    --style "blunt, impatient" --fact "their name=Tom Baker"
price-shopper written · 3 persona(s)
```

`add` writes one whole; `edit` changes what is named and leaves the rest, and `--rename` moves it
to another name. `--llm`, `--tts` and `--voice` say how the caller is played, in the words
`agent set` takes for the agent — the model that improvises it, the vendor and the voice its lines
are read in — and a vendor or a voice the platform does not have is refused when it is written. Unset,
the runtime chooses: its default model, and a voice the agent does not have; `edit --voice ''`
clears one back. `--accepts-when` and `--declines-when` are the caller's own rule for a call: a
judge named `persona` reads every call of theirs against it at hang-up, and the model playing them
is never told it. `show` prints both, and says so when a caller has no rule. `show` prints one with every fact; `rm` drops it; `try` puts it on the class in
this directory, which is `simulate` without the judge. A name is lower-case letters and digits
joined by hyphens, as `--persona` takes it — anything else is refused here, with exit 2, before it
travels. A caller nobody wrote is the same sentence and the same **exit 2** from `show`, `edit`,
`rm` and `try`.

Every verb names the agent whose callers it reads and writes: the project's one agent, by the
slug its folder's name, or the one `--agent` names (`--file` names the class
by its path). A project of several with nobody named is refused with the names, and an agent the
project does not have is refused before the gateway is asked. `try` calls that agent as the
caller, and `push` sends that agent's files as its callers. `--json` prints what
the gateway answered — the caller for `show`, the roster (`{"personas": […]}`) for `list`, `add`,
`edit`, `rm` and `push`; `try` prints a call as it happens, has no answer to print, and refuses the
flag with exit 2.

**`push` is the migration, run once per project**: the personas a project still keeps as files —
`test/<agent>/personas/*.ts` — are sent to the gateway, evaluated as they load, so a file that
computed its state from `lib/` lands as the value it produced. The files are yours to delete
afterwards; the verb never touches them. A caller the gateway refuses stops the push where it
stands: what landed and what is still only a file are both named, and it exits **2** — nothing is
undone, and pushing again once it is fixed finishes the migration.

## `judges`

```
pinecall judges [list] [--org | --agent <name>] [--json]
pinecall judges add <name> --asks '…' [--on every-call|simulations] [--org | --agent <name>] [--json]
pinecall judges rm <name> [--org | --agent <name>] [--json]
```

The runtime judges every finished call on its own panel — `consent`, `grounded`, `promises`, the
compliance judges (`identified` on an outbound call, `disclosed`, `honoured_stop`), and `persona`
on a simulation whose caller wrote a rule. Beside it, two lists the org writes, each
judge one more question the judge model answers held or broken with the whole call in front of it,
the tool calls between the turns included: **the org's** (`--org`), asked of every agent's calls,
and **an agent's own**, about its job alone. Both are kept by the gateway for both environments: the
console's Judges shows the same ones, and a change needs no deploy.

```console
$ pinecall judges add offers-next-slot --asks "The agent offered the next free slot before the caller asked twice."
offers-next-slot written · 1 judge(s)

$ pinecall judges add names-the-doctor --asks "The agent named the doctor of the appointment." --on simulations
names-the-doctor written · 2 judge(s)

$ pinecall judges
names-the-doctor  simulations  The agent named the doctor of the appointment.
offers-next-slot  every call   The agent offered the next free slot before the caller asked twice.

$ pinecall judges add never-medical-advice --org --asks "The agent gave no medical advice: it booked or referred."
never-medical-advice written · 1 judge(s)
```

`add` writes one whole, and the same name again replaces it; `rm` drops it, and a name nobody
wrote is the gateway's sentence and **exit 1**. `--on every-call` (the default) reads every call the
org judges at hang-up; `--on simulations` only a call a persona played — `simulate`, the console's
Simulations, `test --voice` excepted, since a suite's calls are judged by the suite — so it costs
nothing on real traffic. Each judge is one more request to the judge model per call it reads,
under the platform's judging ceiling. Its verdict lands in `call.score` beside the panel's, under the
judge's name; `sessions <call>` and `simulate --judge` print it.

The agent is the project's one, or the one `--agent` names by its folder's name; `--org`
names the org's list instead, needs no project, and beside `--agent` is refused. One of the
platform's own names — `consent`, `grounded`, `promises`, `persona`, `identified`, `disclosed`,
`honoured_stop`, `heard` — a name the org and an agent would share, or a question left blank is the gateway's refusal. A name is
lower-case letters and digits joined by hyphens, as a verdict names it; anything else, an `add`
without `--asks`, or an `--on` that is neither word is refused here with **exit 2**, before it
travels. `--json` prints what the gateway answered, `{"judges": […]}`, for every verb.

## `eval`

```
pinecall eval <call-id> [--policy policy.json] [--json]
```

One finished call rebuilt from its log and answered by the runtime's six **code** checks —
`consent`, `register`, `errors`, `latency`, `talk` and `interruptions`. Nothing is re-run and no
model is asked. Each answers `held`, `broken`, `deferred` or `skipped`; exits 1 when one is `broken`.

```console
$ pinecall eval call_29d7c7b6cdd643de9c659984a0125c8c
call_29d7c7b6cdd643de9c659984a0125c8c  clinica-norte
  consent        held      no irreversible tool ran in this call; 1 tool call(s) did
  register       skipped   no words were declared for this call: send them as `banned` …
  errors         held      the call logged no error
  latency        broken    llm_node_ttft 1.209s > 1.000s at its worst of 1 turns; e2e_latency 2.638s > 2.000s at its worst of 1 turns
  talk           skipped   no talk_share in the budget: send one, the most of the talking the agent may do (0 to 1)
  interruptions  skipped   no reply of the agent's was cut off in this call
```

`--policy` is `{"banned": ["tarifa plana"], "budget": {"e2e_latency": 2.0, "llm_node_ttft": 1.0,
"tts_node_ttfb": 0.6, "talk_share": 0.6}}`: the words this business will not have its agent say,
the seconds it holds each turn's worst latency to (livekit's own names; `interruption_delay` too),
and the most of the talking the agent may do. A budget replaces the defaults — those three latencies
at those values — so a key it does not name is not checked, and a budget with no latency key it
recognises leaves `latency` `skipped`.

## `runs`

```
pinecall runs list [--limit n] | show <id> | diff <a> <b>
pinecall runs promote <call-id> [--name x] [--out test/candidates] [--from-seq n]
pinecall runs drift --agent <slug> [--window 7d] [--baseline 30d] [--threshold 10] [--limit 200]
                … any of them with --json: what the gateway answered, for a pipe
```

```console
$ pinecall runs list --limit 3
run_8a8870b59bc1  2026-09-11 12:47:23  clinica-norte     done     1/1
run_5c6b559d6093  2026-09-11 11:56:49  clinica-norte     done     2/2
```

`show` prints one run the way `test` printed its matrix when it happened — without the first
line, which carries the run id and belongs to a run that is still happening; `diff` says what moved between
two, golden by golden — a measurement that HELD and is new to the later run is not a change and is
left out, one that is BROKEN is printed (`not measured → broken`), and one the later run stopped
making is printed too, so a golden nobody ran is never read as a fix. **`promote`** writes one real call down as a golden **candidate** in
`test/candidates` — the golden the gateway derives from it (`GET /v1/calls/{call}/golden`): the
state it was in at `--from-seq`, every caller turn after it, the facts the app gave it, what memory
recalled, the day it ran, and an `expect` from its **broken** verdicts — for a person to edit
before it counts as a golden. Promote is for the call that **broke**: a verdict says what went
wrong, never what was right, so the expect says what must not happen again — the tool a broken
`consent` ran unasked in `not_tools`, `grounded: true`, the other judges that broke in `judges`,
asked again by name — and the verb prints a note for each. A call that held gives an empty
`expect`, and you write what it must keep doing. The same golden is what [`cases keep`](#cases)
keeps on the gateway instead, for a case that belongs in the dataset rather than in the repository.
**`drift`** counts each judge's held-rate over two windows of finished calls and exits 1 when one
fell further than `--threshold` points: nothing is judged again, a held-rate is a count of the
verdicts `call.score` already carries. The window is the last `--window`; the baseline is the time
before it, back to `--baseline` ago, so `--baseline` must be longer than `--window` or it is refused
with exit 2. It reads the agent's newest `--limit` calls, **200** by default, which is the sessions
endpoint's own ceiling, so a window wider than that is counted over those 200.

## `cases`

```
pinecall cases [list] [--status pending|approved|dismissed] [--agent <name>] [--json]
pinecall cases show <name> · approve <name> · reopen <name> · forget <name>
pinecall cases dismiss <name> [--judge-was-wrong <judge>] [--note '…']
pinecall cases pull <name> [--out test/<agent>/goldens]
pinecall cases keep <call-id> --name x [--held-out]
```

**Real calls are the dataset.** A call a judge broke on is kept by the gateway at hang-up as a
**pending** case — its caller's lines, the state it opened in, the facts the app gave it, what
memory recalled, the day it ran — with an `expect` that says what must not happen again: the tool
a broken `consent` ran unasked in `not_tools`, `grounded: true`, and every other judge that broke
(`promises`, the compliance judges, the org's and the agent's own) in `judges`, asked again of
the replay by name. A person reads it, reproduces it, fixes the agent, and approves it into the
nightly or dismisses it:

```console
$ pinecall cases

  pinecall cases dismiss promises-youll-call-me-tomorrow-29d7c7   nothing to fix; --judge-was-wrong <judge> when the judge was
```

The inbox lists the agent's cases, the pending first, newest first: status, name, the judges that
broke, the world the call ran in, its age — and above them how many wait of the most that may
(past it a broken call is judged as ever and not kept until a person decides some). `--status`
lists one. A case is addressed by its **name** within the agent — the project's one, or the one
`--agent` names; a name the agent has none of is said and **exit 1**.

`approve` puts it in the nightly (`pinecall test --dataset`). `dismiss` takes it out:
`--judge-was-wrong <judge>` says the judge that broke should have held, which the gateway keeps as
a calibration label of the call, `--note` beside it; a judge the case did not break on is the
gateway's refusal, and `--note` without a judge is refused here, since it is kept on that label.
`reopen` makes it pending again. **`pull`** writes the case's golden as `<name>.json` in
`test/<agent>/goldens/` (`--out` moves it) — the golden as the case holds it, `promoted_from` and
all — and only then marks the case as kept in the repository, so the nightly plays the file and
not the case. **`keep <call-id> --name x`** keeps a finished call as an approved case, with the
`expect` its broken verdicts give; `--held-out` plays it only when a run names it — a release's
check rather than the nightly's. **`forget`** drops the case; the call it came from stays.

A case is the org's, kept from either world, and played in the sandbox only. `--json` prints what
the gateway answered — the list, or the case — with the fields it leaves at their defaults written
in; `pull --json` prints `{path, case}`. A flag that is another verb's is refused with **exit 2**,
before anything travels.

With a call id (`sessions <call>`, or `sessions show <call>` — `list` and `show` are both optional
words): that call's **outcome**, how long it ran and why it ended, what it cost in US dollars with a
line per priced row under it (the model, the ears, the voice, the memory model at hang-up, each
phone leg in minutes begun) and a line for anything the platform has no rate for, and the **score**,
one line per judge with the question it answered and its own reasoning when it did not hold. The judging happens at hang-up, in the gateway; this verb reads it back and runs
nothing. A call still running says so instead of reporting itself unjudged, and an id this gateway
has no log for is refused by name: it does not print a summary of nothing.

**What an agent runs on is its settings', unless its class declares it** — per environment, per
corner, a version a row (the runtime's `docs/protocol/settings-api.md`). The class declares the
contract: its tools, its state, its `render()`. The language, the voice, the models, the opening,
how a call ends, how a turn is cut, what is remembered, what is known by heart and which bases are
searched are **settings**, kept by the gateway and laid over the class at the one place every
session is built. A class may declare any of them itself (`@voice`, `@llm`, `@stt` and its static
fields; the site's *Settings in the class*), and **what the class declares wins**: the table prints
`class` for that field in every corner — `voice` above — and a `set` or a `clear` that changes it is
refused, nothing saved, in the gateway's sentence: `voice set by the class of clinica-norte: the
class's declaration wins over these settings, so change it there, or take it out of the class to set
it here`. `--tts` and `--tts-model` are the class's `voice`; `--temperature`, `--llm-builds` and
`--llm-option` its `llm`; `--stt-builds` and `--stt-option` its `stt`. Which fields are fixed is
what the process holding the agent in that environment declared: with none holding it, none is.

**A plugin's own class and options are three pairs of flags, one per stage.** `--llm-builds` names a
class of the vendor's LiveKit plugin other than its default, a dot reaching into a module of it
(`responses.LLM`); `--llm-option key=value` passes one keyword argument as the plugin names it, and
repeats — the value read as JSON when it is JSON (`true`, `1000`, `[1,2]`), as text otherwise. The
options a row sets replace the whole list it had; `clear llm-options` takes them out. Each one
replaces Pinecall's option of the same name for the vendor. A set that changes them tries the stage
once before anything is kept, so a class the plugin does not export, or an argument it does not
take, is refused in its own words. **They run only on the org's own key for the vendor**: on a key
Pinecall lends, the set is refused with `llm options and builds run on the org's own openai key, and
this agent's llm would run on the platform's: add yours with pinecall providers add openai, or take them
out` — an option can point a plugin at another server, and a lent key never goes anywhere but the
vendor. `--temperature` is the model's, in the vendor's own range, and runs on any key.

**How a turn is decided is four numbers, and two of them are confidences.** `--endpointing-ms` is
the longest silence a caller is left in before the turn is called finished, and
`--min-interruption-words` how many words it takes to stop the agent mid-sentence. The other two
are for a recogniser that decides the end of a turn *itself* — Deepgram Flux, which is the
runtime's own ears: `--eot-threshold` is how sure it must be before it ends one, and
`--eager-eot-threshold` the lower bar at which it says a turn MIGHT be over, which is what lets
the model start on an answer that is thrown away if the caller carries on.

The first of those is the knob that decides whether an agent answers half a sentence. Deepgram's
own measurement of its default, 0.7, is that as much as a fifth of the turns it ends were ended
before the person had finished speaking — on a line, an agent that replies to the first half of
"normal cleaning needed, it gets done every couple of months" and runs a tool on half the facts.
`--eot-threshold 0.85 --eager-eot-threshold 0.4` is Deepgram's own pairing for a line that must
not cut anybody off: the turn is committed only when Flux is sure, and the latency that would
cost is bought back by the eager bar. The eager one may never sit above the other, and a set that
would is refused before it is written.

**`--record on|off` says whether this agent's calls keep their audio**, and it is typed rather
than being a bare flag because the answer worth being able to give is no. A corner that sets it
decides for the copies built there; a corner that says nothing falls through to the one below, and
an agent nobody has told keeps its audio. What is kept is the whole room — the caller, the agent,
the hold music, and a supervisor who took the line — served back by the console's session screen
and by `pinecall sessions`. `pinecall agent clear record` gives the answer back to the corner below.

**`--max-duration 1-60|off` is the longest a voice call of this agent runs**, in minutes; unset
anywhere it is ten. A minute before it the agent is told to close and say goodbye, and at it the
call ends after the sentence being said — `timeout` by the `platform` in the call's log. `off` is
no limit. It holds on the phone and on the widget's voice, never on a written conversation, and a
supervisor on the line does not stop the clock. `pinecall agent clear max-duration` gives it back
to the corner below.

**`--language <tag>` is the language the agent's calls are in** — `en`, `es`, `pt-BR` — and what
the voice, the ears and the turn-taking are set to; unset anywhere, each vendor keeps its own
default. It is not a field of the class, and a class that still declares `language` is refused at
load with this verb. The prompt does not follow it: the framework's own rules are English for
every agent, one of them is to answer in the language the caller speaks, and the class's docstring
and `render()` are in whatever language the tenant wrote them. A blank tag is refused with exit 2
and nothing is written; `pinecall agent clear language` takes it out of the corner.

**A model knob takes a tier by its short name.** `--llm haiku` · `sonnet` · `opus` are expanded
here to the model id the provider answers to — the same table `pinecall test --model` reads — so
the corner never holds a name that is a 404 at the vendor. `haiku` is `claude-haiku-5-5`. `--llm <vendor>/<model>`, a vendor
alone and a model alone travel as typed; a word that names no model at all (an empty one, half a
`vendor/model`) is refused with exit 2 and nothing is written.

**Three corners.** In the sandbox your key has a corner of its own: what you `set` is yours, and a
colleague's next call does not hear it — so two developers testing two voices never change each
other's. A corner that set nothing reads the team's (`(team's)` in your column), which is the org's
own corner, written with `--team`. Production has one corner, and **`--prod` writes it directly**:
`pinecall agent set --voice carolina --note "warmer" --prod`, by a person whose production switch
is on — the same change the production console's Settings tab makes. There is no promote between
the corners: what guards production is the goldens in CI before a deploy
([production.md](https://github.com/pinecall/agents/blob/main/docs/production.md)), and the history after it.

**Versions.** Every `set` is a new row; nothing is updated, nothing deleted. The whole set travels
with the version it was read at, so two people saving at once never write over each other: the
second is told `this corner is at v4 now, not the version you read`. `history` prints every version
with who set it, why, and what it changed; `diff` reads this corner against the team's or
production's; `rollback <n>` brings one back as the next version — `rollback <n> --prod` is how a
production change that went wrong is undone, in one line.

**What is running, and where.** `list` prints every process holding the org's agents in the environment
asked — one line an app socket: its id, the agents it holds, whose corner, the machine and address
it connected from, the SDK, and since when:

```console
$ pinecall agent list --prod
app_7  clinica-norte  the org's · web-1 (34.68.177.78) · pinecall/0.5.1 · since 2026-09-19 14:02
```

`stop <app>` closes that socket with the `stopped` code (`POST /v1/apps/{app}/stop`, a key with
`app`): the process prints `stopped by <name>` and exits instead of dialling back, and its agents
are free. A supervisor that restarts whatever exits — systemd's `Restart=always`, pm2 — starts it
again, so a process kept that way is stopped where it is supervised. An app on the SDK hears it on
`pc.onStopped(why => …)`. The Overview's Processes card is the same list, with a Stop per row.

**Git, for whoever wants it.** `pinecall agent pull > pinecall/clinica-norte.json` writes the corner's
config as a file; `pinecall agent push pinecall/clinica-norte.json --team` sends it back as the next
version, with no version check — it is what CI applies, and `push … --prod` is what a release
applies to production. A corner that set nothing has nothing to pull: `pull` says so on stderr,
prints nothing and exits 1, so `pull > file` in a script fails rather than keeping an empty file.

### `agent knowledge`

```
pinecall agent knowledge [--team]
pinecall agent knowledge edit [--team] [--note '…']
```

**What the agent knows by heart** — the business as the org describes it, a page of Markdown:
hours, prices, what needs an authorisation, what to say when asked for the doctor's mobile. It
is one field of the settings, versioned like the rest, and the runtime reads it **whole** into
the prompt's static `knowledge` block on every call — so it is read once and cached, and never
searched. Alone, the verb prints the corner's text; `edit` opens it in `$VISUAL` or `$EDITOR`,
the way `git commit` does, and what you leave is the next version. An unchanged file writes
nothing; an empty one takes the field out. The console's Settings ▸ Knowledge is the same
textarea, and a **supervisor's or a manager's key opens it** (`words`) — the person who knows
the prices changes them, without a developer and without a deploy.

```console
$ pinecall agent knowledge
clinica-norte knows nothing by heart in your corner: `pinecall agent knowledge edit` writes it
$ EDITOR=vim pinecall agent knowledge edit --team --note "prices for 2027"
clinica-norte · knowledge 2,140 chars · the team's corner v12
```

It is not the RAG. The documents a turn *searches* — a catalogue, a policy manual, anything
too long to read whole — are [`pinecall docs`](#docs), attached to the same settings as `bases`.
`pinecall agent` prints the two on two rows: `knowledge` as a size, `bases` by name.

## `lexicon`

```
pinecall lexicon [--agent <slug>] [--json]
pinecall lexicon add <word> --say '…' [--agent <slug>] [--team] [--note '…']
pinecall lexicon hear <word> [<word> …] [--agent <slug>] [--team] [--note '…']
pinecall lexicon rm <word> [<word> …] [--agent <slug>] [--team]
pinecall lexicon history [--agent <slug>] [--team]
                                        … and any of them with --prod, in production
```

```console
$ pinecall lexicon add DKV --say "de ka uve"
lexicon · sandbox · your corner
  said     DKV → "de ka uve"
  heard    —
$ pinecall lexicon hear "Vidal Ferrán"
lexicon · sandbox · your corner
  said     DKV → "de ka uve"
  heard    Vidal Ferrán
$ pinecall lexicon history
lexicon · sandbox · corner m_berna_default
  v3 · m_berna_default · 2026-10-09 12:18   said 1 · heard 1
```

An agent's words: its `says` and `hears`, which the class never sets. The agent is the one of
this directory, or the one `--agent` names by its slug, as [`agent`](#agent) names it. Whole and
versioned like the settings, per corner, with the same `--team` and the same refusal when the
corner moved. A **supervisor's or a manager's key opens it** (`words`): the person who hears a word
said wrong forty times a day fixes it, without a developer and without a deploy — with `--prod`, in
production, while their switch is on; the agent's Settings ▸ Lexicon tab in the console is the
same edit.
`history` and a word put back are the undo.

A word the voice is told to say another way is still the word written everywhere else: the
transcript, the console and the judges read `Pinecall`, never "pain-col".


`pinecall memory policy [--agent <slug>] [--remember '…' …] [--forget '…' …] [--team] [--note '…']` is the memory field of the
same settings, on its own for the person whose job it is: what the agent keeps about a caller and
what it never does.

## `pipeline`

```
pinecall pipeline [--agent <slug>] [--json]
```

```console
$ pinecall pipeline
clinica-norte · 9 calls

  hears     soniox · es
  decides   anthropic · claude-haiku-5-5
  speaks    elevenlabs · EXAVITQu4vr4xnSDxMaL · es

  greeting  "Clínica Norte, good morning. How can I help you?"

  transcription_delay 0.39s · end_of_turn_delay 0.41s · llm_node_ttft 0.86s · e2e_latency 2.36s
```

The three legs as the **next** call would be built. It reads and nothing else: the six knobs are fields of the settings now, and
`pinecall agent set` sets them with the rest — a model knob reads four ways there,
`--llm anthropic/claude-haiku-5-5`, `--llm cartesia` (a vendor, its own model), `--llm
claude-haiku-5-5` (a model, the vendor in use), and `--llm haiku` (a tier, expanded to the id its
provider answers to, exactly as `pinecall test --model haiku` expands it). `pinecall pipeline set`
and `clear` say so and exit 2. `pinecall providers` lists every vendor a stage may be moved onto.

## `supervise`

```
pinecall supervise <call>
```

```console
$ pinecall supervise call_daab0b5d567c49968adc52e8d44c248c
call_daab0b5d567c49968adc52e8d44c248c · the audio of a live call is the console, which has a room — `pinecall start` prints its URL; this is the transcript and the desk
> s Hello from the desk, I am taking over for a moment.
> w
not a move. w · s · t · x · e · q
> q
```

The call's transcript as it happens, and one line to move on it:

```
w <text>    whisper to the agent — the caller never hears it
s <text>    say it to the caller, in the agent's voice, verbatim
t           take the line: the agent stops speaking and you are on it
x           give it back
e [reason]  end the call
q           leave the desk; the call goes on
```

Every move lands in the caller's own log as its own `supervisor.*` entry with a seq, so what a
human did to a call is read the same way as what the agent did. The **audio** of a live call is
the console's Live screen, which has a room; this is the transcript and the desk.

A desk opens on a call that is **happening**: one that has ended, and an id this gateway has no
log for, are refused before the prompt — what a finished call was is `pinecall sessions show`.

An assistant has the same desk as the MCP's `supervise` tool ([Supervising a live call](mcp/supervising.md)).

It takes its moves from a **pipe** too, one per line, which is how a script moves a call:
`printf 't\ns Putting you through to the front desk.\nq\n' | pinecall supervise <call>`. Through a pipe there is
no prompt drawn, and the desk leaves when the lines run out.

## `numbers`

```
pinecall numbers list
pinecall numbers available [--account <id>]
pinecall numbers import <+34…> --agent <slug> [--channel phone|whatsapp] [--dry-run]
pinecall numbers drop <+34…>
```

**Adding a number to the org from a terminal is `numbers import`**: the number is one an account of
the org owns, and the account itself is kept first with [`carriers add`](#carriers) when the org
does not hold it yet. A Twilio number reaching an agent is these two lines, and nothing else:

```console
$ pinecall carriers add twilio --account-sid AC0123… --user SK4567…   # once, the secret on stdin
$ pinecall numbers import +34910000000 --agent clinica-norte          # the number, to the agent
```

**Which numbers there are to import is `numbers available`** (`GET /v1/numbers/available`): every
number the org's Twilio accounts own, every page of Twilio's, one per line with its name at the
carrier and its account, and `routed here` or `not routed here` for the environment asked. `--account` asks
one account of several. It is per environment: a number production routes reads `not routed here` in the
sandbox, so look with `--prod` before importing one there.

**`not routed here` is not `free`.** The list knows what **this org** routes in this environment, and
nothing about a number held on another org's trunk of the same Twilio account: that one is found out
at import, as a `409` naming the trunk and asking for `move`. `numbers import <number> --agent <slug>
--dry-run` is the check, and a `409` is a number to leave alone. A SIP peer owns what it owns and
lists nothing; its import takes the number as typed.

```console
$ pinecall numbers available --prod
+13158182774 · (315) 818-2774 · AC5f7c… · routed here
+16814413619 · (681) 441-3619 · AC5f7c… · not routed here
```

A number is **one environment's** and reaches one agent: it is imported where it answers, and `list`
shows that environment's — the sandbox's, or production's with `--prod`. No verb here moves a number
between the two; the console's Numbers screen does (`PUT /v1/numbers/{number}/env`, which re-routes the
carrier's trunk), because a number is a route in one environment's table and a carrier call that matched
two would be refused.

`import` takes a number the org's carrier account already owns and points it here: the carrier's
trunk, the SFU's trunk, the route — `--dry-run` prints those steps and writes nothing, which is
what you read before letting the gateway touch a carrier account. `drop` forgets the route and
takes the number off the SFU trunk; the carrier account keeps it, so nobody is un-bought by a typo.
Whose corner a ring lands in, once an environment is answering it, is [`line`](#line).

## `carriers`

```
pinecall carriers list
pinecall carriers show [<account>]
pinecall carriers add twilio --account-sid <AC…> --user <SK…> [--label <name>]
pinecall carriers add sip --username <user> --address <ip or network>… [--outbound-host <host>]
                      [--outbound-transport auto|udp|tcp|tls] [--outbound-username <user>] [--label <name>]
pinecall carriers add whatsapp --phone-number-id <id> [--label <name>]
pinecall carriers drop [<account>]
```

A carrier account is **where the org's numbers live**, and the org holds as many as it has: a
Twilio account, a SIP peer (its own PBX, or a carrier with no API here), a WhatsApp number at
Meta. An account is the org's, one for both environments; a number it owns is routed to an agent with
[`numbers import`](#numbers), in the environment it should answer in. So bringing a Twilio number to an
agent is two verbs:

```console
$ pinecall carriers add twilio --account-sid AC0123… --user SK4567… --label Clínica
Twilio secret (the API key's, or the auth token):
kept: AC0123… · twilio · Clínica
  route one of its numbers: `pinecall numbers import <+34…> --agent <slug>`
$ pinecall numbers import +34910000000 --agent clinica-norte
```

**Every secret is read on stdin, never from the command line**, where `ps` and the shell's history
would keep it: typed with nothing echoed on a terminal, or piped one per line —
`printf '%s\n' "$TWILIO_SECRET" | pinecall carriers add twilio …`. A SIP peer reads its password,
and its outbound password on a second line when `--outbound-username` is given. Nothing is printed
back: the gateway seals each secret under the platform's vault key and answers the account by its id.

- **Twilio.** `--user` is an API key SID (make one at Twilio → Account → API keys, and revoke it
  there any time) or the account SID again, with the auth token as the secret. The pair is tried
  against Twilio before anything is kept, so a pair Twilio refuses is `Twilio refused these
  credentials` and exit 1. With a Twilio account the platform finds the trunk that points at it, or
  makes one, when a number is imported.
- **A SIP peer.** `--address` is each network it calls from, repeated: an IPv4 address or a network
  no wider than a `/24`, public. Each one **waits for the operator** to approve it before
  5060 opens to it; `show` prints `waiting`, `approved` or `refused` beside each. The four
  `--outbound-*` flags say where the platform dials it; unsaid, the platform dials with the pair it
  registers with.
- **WhatsApp.** `--phone-number-id` is the number's id at Meta, and the access token is the secret.
  Meta is asked for that number with that token before anything is kept, so an id or a token Meta
  does not open is `Meta does not open WhatsApp number <id> with this token: …` and exit 1.

`add` with an account the org already holds **replaces its secret**: that is how a key is rotated.
An account's id is its own: Twilio's account SID, the peer's username, Meta's phone number id.
`list` is every account, oldest first, one line each with its id; `show` is one, the org's only
account or the one named; `drop` forgets one, and with several the id is required. **Its numbers
stay routed** until each is let go with `numbers drop`, so forgetting an account never silences a
line by surprise. The same accounts are the console's **Numbers** screen, *Add a number* —
[the console](https://docs.pinecall.io/supervision/console/) — and the REST endpoints are
[phone numbers](https://docs.pinecall.io/channels/phone-numbers/), "The accounts".

## `providers`

```
pinecall providers [--does llm|stt|tts]   # every vendor this build runs
pinecall providers add <vendor>     # the key on stdin, never on the command line
pinecall providers rm <vendor>
pinecall providers list             # only the ones this org brought
```

```console
$ pinecall providers --does tts
vendor        does         standing   variable              also known as
livekit       llm,stt,tts  ready                            inference lk
cartesia      stt,tts      no key     CARTESIA_API_KEY
elevenlabs    stt,tts      ready      ELEVEN_API_KEY        11labs eleven elevenlab
rime          tts          no key     RIME_API_KEY
speechmatics  stt,tts      no plugin  SPEECHMATICS_API_KEY
```

With nothing after it: every vendor this build runs — forty-five, every one LiveKit ships a plugin
for, plus `livekit` itself, which is LiveKit Inference and fronts most of them on the platform's own
project with no vendor key at all. `standing` is the one word for what each is still waiting for:
`ready` is the only one that runs a call, `no plugin` and `no key` are the operator's to fix, and
`its own` is a vendor whose credentials are a chain or a pair and never one key anybody could
bring. Any of these names — or any of its aliases — is what `agent set --stt`, `--llm` and
`--tts` take: the six knobs are the agent's settings, and `pipeline` only reads them back.

A key added here is this org's own account with that vendor, and every call of this org runs on it
from the next one; every vendor nobody brought runs on the platform's own key. `add` reads the key from
**stdin** — typed with nothing echoed on a terminal, one piped line off one — and never from a
flag: argv is visible in `ps` to every user on the platform, and a key pasted as an argument is a key in
the shell history.

No endpoint a person reads ever answers with a provider key: `list` prints the vendors and nothing
else, not a value, not a prefix, not a fingerprint. The one endpoint that reads a key back is the
**worker's** — `GET /v1/agents/{slug}/provider-keys`, an org's own keys handed to the org's own
process, on that org's key — which is the whole reason the vault exists. A key that was lost is set
again. A runtime with no `PINECALL_VAULT_KEY` cannot keep somebody else's
secret and says so with a 503; the vault, and how to turn it on, is the gateway API's §6.

## `voices`

```
pinecall voices [--tts <vendor>] [--language es] [--country ES]
pinecall voices play <voice> ["the words"] [--tts <vendor>] [--model <model>] [--language es] [--save file.wav]
```

```console
$ pinecall voices --language es --country ES
a7beff01-8f8b-4809-bfe6-e2166e57e0c2  Iria - Thoughtful Communicator  feminine   ES castilian
de38f545-c574-44e8-9b54-a7d6fec1c6b1  Marta - Friendly Guide          feminine   ES castilian
35b2cfc1-e6fb-4d69-a598-c1780612be4a  Darío - Steady Operator         masculine  ES castilian
$ pinecall voices --tts rime
rime lists no voices: its voice is the vendor's own id, set as it is — these list theirs: cartesia, elevenlabs, inworld, nvidia, speechify (--tts <vendor>)
$ pinecall voices play de38f545-c574-44e8-9b54-a7d6fec1c6b1 "Hi, this is Clínica Norte's assistant." --language en
de38f545-c574-44e8-9b54-a7d6fec1c6b1 · first audio 578 ms · whole sentence 915 ms · afplay
```

With nothing after it: the vendor's voices in that language, one per line — the id the agent's
`voice` setting takes, then the name and, where the vendor says them, the gender and where the
accent is from. The country is the column that matters for Spanish: `ES` is Spain and `MX` is
Mexico, and a language code does not tell them apart; `--country` keeps one. The vendor is `--tts`,
or **the platform's own voice** when none is named — `defaults.tts` of `GET /v1/providers`, what an
agent that names no vendor speaks with. A vendor lists its voices when its livekit plugin does —
ElevenLabs, Inworld, NVIDIA and Speechify — or when the platform's providers row lists them for it, as
data (`listed`, by vendor and language: on `cloud.pinecall.io`, Cartesia's in Spanish and English);
`voices_listed` in the same catalogue says which, and it is what the console's picker reads too. A
vendor listed by neither takes its voice as the id the vendor gives it: `voices` says so, names the
vendors that list theirs, and exits 1 without asking for a list. Any id plays, listed or not.

`play` says the words in that voice through the vendor's own plugin, exactly as a call would build
it (`POST /v1/voices/sample`, the wire's `VoiceSample`), and plays the WAV on this machine with
whichever of `afplay`, `ffplay`, `play`, `aplay` or `pw-play` it finds — a player that fails is
said so, with the file kept and named, and exit 1. With no words the gateway reads one line in the
language, so every client hears the same one. Beside it are the vendor's two numbers: how long
until the first audio — the wait a caller hears after they stop talking — and the whole sentence;
a dash when the gateway sent none. `--save file.wav` keeps the WAV there and plays it from there.
It runs on the org's own key for the vendor when it brought one, and on the platform's otherwise; both
endpoints ask for `pipeline`, the scope that may change the voice. The gateway refuses in one sentence
what the settings endpoint would refuse — a typo in the voice, a vendor this build has no row for, a
model it does not vouch for, more than 400 characters (`422`) — and says `429` past thirty samples
a minute on one key, `503` when nobody has a key for the vendor, `409` when the vendor refused
that key, `502` when it did not answer. The voice it plays is set with `pinecall agent set --tts
cartesia --tts-model sonic-3 --voice <id>`: a model tried with `--model` is kept only when
`--tts-model` names it too.

## `callbacks`

```
pinecall callbacks [--agent <slug>] [--after <cursor>]
```

```console
$ pinecall callbacks
gateway https://cloud.pinecall.io · key from .env · sandbox
nobody is waiting for a call back
```

The numbers people left when every seat of the fleet was taken: a phone caller the overflow agent
answered, or a web visitor who left a number at the widget after `POST /v1/tokens` answered `503`.
One line each — when, the agent, the number, the channel, who took it — oldest first, and a
`more: --after <cursor>` line when there is another page. The runtime records them
(`callback.requested`, on the agent's log); dialing back is your app's.

What the org keeps in the environment the key acts in (`--prod` for production), and taking it out.

`erase call` takes one ended call: its log, its facts, the memories it taught and its recording,
in one transaction (`DELETE /v1/calls/{call}`); a call still running is refused. `erase contact` is
a person's "delete my data": every call they were on in the environment and every fact kept of them
(`DELETE /v1/contacts/{contact}`), by the number or the id the call carried. Neither can be undone,
so both ask for `--yes`. The dial ledger keeps the numbers and the time of a call, never what was
said: a carrier's traceback asks for it.

```
$ pinecall data erase contact +14155550142 --yes
2026-09-29 18:02  contact +14155550142  3 call(s), 212 entries, 4 memories, 3 recording(s)  by m_ana
```

`erasures` is the trail (`GET /v1/org/erasures`): what went, when, and who asked — a person, a key,
`retention` for the nightly run, `operator` for an org erased whole. It outlives the org.

`reads` is who read the org's calls (`GET /v1/org/reads`): a person reading a call's log or its
recording at the console or with their key, the operator reading one off the platform, and a traceback
the operator ran on a number — once an hour per reader, call and kind, newest first; a call id or
a number after it narrows the list to that one. A server's key and a visitor's page write nothing.
It is the access log a breach notification starts from.

`policy` is the org's compliance settings, one row at `GET`·`PUT /v1/org/policy`, read with no flag
and changed a field at a time (the row is read and written back whole, so the other fields stay):
`--retention-days <n>` is how many days a sealed call is kept before the platform's nightly run erases
it, `--keep-all` clears it; `--calling-hours 9-20` the hours of the called number's own day a call
may ring, `--any-hours` clears them; `--per-number-day <n>` how many times one number is rung in 24
hours, `--no-per-number` clears it. A US or Canadian number keeps the US floor — 8 to 21 and three
a day — whatever is set wider; the sandbox and your own verified phone are held to neither.
`--consent-everywhere` asks for a consent on file for a number of any country, `--consent-by-law`
for a `+1` number only (the default).

What a spoken call says before its greeting is the policy's too, said in the agent's voice and
logged as its first `turn.agent`. An outbound call opens with the disclosure: the platform's
sentence in the agent's language by default (*"This is an automated assistant calling on behalf of
Clínica Norte."*, `--platform-disclosure`), your own words (`--disclosure '…'`), or none
(`--no-disclosure`, and then your greeting must say it is an automated assistant). A recorded call,
either direction, then says *"This call may be recorded."*; `--no-recording-notice` turns that off.

```
$ pinecall data policy --retention-days 365 --calling-hours 9-20
retention:      a sealed call is erased 365 day(s) after it started
calling hours:  a number is rung from 9:00 to 20:00 of its own day
per number:     no limit of calls to one number a day (a +1 number: 3)
consent:        a +1 number needs a consent on file
outbound opens: the platform's sentence ("This is an automated assistant calling on behalf of …")
recording:      a recorded call says "This call may be recorded."
set by m_ana
```

`consent <number>` is what stands for a number in the environment — consented, on the do-not-call list,
or nothing on file — and every fact about it, newest first (`GET /v1/org/consents/{number}`).
`--give express|written --source '…'` records a consent, with the `--text` the person agreed to and
an `--evidence` (a URL, a document id); `--opt-out` puts the number on the list. A call to a US or
Canadian number in production needs a consent on file (or one sent with the dial), and a number on
the list is never dialled, whatever consent the dial carries: only a consent recorded here lifts it.

```
$ pinecall data consent +14155550142
+14155550142  on the do-not-call list
  2026-09-29 18:40  opt_out   the caller asked the agent  by agent:front-desk  on call_9f2c…
  2026-09-20 10:02  express   the booking form  by m_ana
```

`dnc` is the list itself (`GET /v1/org/dnc`, a page at a time), `dnc add <number>…` puts numbers on
it, and `dnc import <file>` takes a file of them, one a line — the org's own list, or the scrub of
the National Do Not Call Registry the org ran on its own account (`POST /v1/org/dnc`). Both ask for
`--source`, which the list keeps beside each number.

`export` streams the org's environment whole as JSON Lines (`GET /v1/org/export`): a header, every call
with its facts and its whole log, every memory, every version of every agent's settings and words,
every knowledge document. `--out` writes a file and says so on stderr; without it, stdout, for a
pipe. Recordings are not inlined: `pinecall sessions` names them.

## `link`

```
pinecall link [--org <slug>] [--gateway <url>]
```

**This project's folder, tied to one of your orgs.** Run in the project's folder: it signs this
machine in through the browser when it is not ([`login`](#login), the same dance), lists your orgs
(`GET /v1/login/orgs`), asks which one this project is — `--org` names it — and mints your key
there (`POST /v1/login/org`), unless it is the org this machine is signed in to, whose key it
already holds. The key goes into `./.env` as `PINECALL_KEY`, and `PINECALL_URL` beside it when the
gateway is not `https://cloud.pinecall.io`; every other line of the file is left as it was. That one
key opens both environments at that one gateway — the sandbox without `--prod`, production with it —
and nothing else is written or derived ([above](#where-the-gateway-and-the-key-come-from)).

```console
~/clinica $ pinecall link --org clinica
▸ clinica · PINECALL_KEY written to .env
git would commit .env: add it to .gitignore before a commit carries your key
```

The last line is said every time until the project's `.gitignore` names `.env`: a key committed is
a key published. Every verb run in this folder, or under it, reads the key from there; a project of
another org is another folder, linked on its own. `--gateway` names another gateway than the one
this machine last signed in to. A server does not link: it runs on a server's token from the
console's Tokens screen, kept in its secrets ([production.md](https://github.com/pinecall/agents/blob/main/docs/production.md)).

## `login`

```
pinecall login [gateway-url]
```

`login` **prints a link and opens it**. You sign in there — in a browser, where a password belongs,
where the browser autofills it and a password manager holds it — and the page hands this terminal a
key of its **own**: minted for you, labelled as this machine, revoked on its own from the Tokens
screen. Nothing types a password into a shell, and the day your org signs in with Google this verb
does not change.

```console
$ pinecall login
gateway  https://cloud.pinecall.io   (the default — `pinecall login <url>` for your own)

open this to sign in:
https://cloud.pinecall.io/cli?c=cli_…

waiting…
signed in to https://cloud.pinecall.io as Ana García
```

**It signs the machine in, and no verb runs on that.** The key is proved at `/v1/whoami` and kept
in `~/.pinecall/session.json`; what a project runs on is the key [`link`](#link) mints from it into
the project's `.env`. `link` signs in on its own when it has to, so this is rarely typed. With no
URL it is `https://cloud.pinecall.io`, and it says so above the link, so a person who meant their
own platform sees the assumption before anything is kept. The URL is the one gateway's, and the key it
leaves opens both of its environments; the sandbox keeps no password of its own. The word in the link
dies in ten minutes and on first collection; a terminal with no browser prints the same link and
you open it from wherever you are. A server has no login at all.

## `whoami`

```
pinecall whoami [--prod]
```

**The one endpoint**: `PINECALL_URL`, with the key from the environment or the project's `.env`, on
one line with where the key came from; under it what the gateway says the key is in the environment
asked — the sandbox, or production with `--prod`: the org (its slug, or its id when the gateway
carries none), the key's id, the environment, the label it was issued under, and whether the key may act
in production — your switch, an admin's always, or a production server token; and under that
which environments the key opens there: a person's key both, the sandbox without `--prod` and production
with it while the switch is on; a server's token the one its prefix names. The exit code is the
gateway's answer: 0 when it said who the key is, 1 when it refused, in its words. The key itself is
neither printed nor sent anywhere else.

```console
$ pinecall whoami
gateway https://cloud.pinecall.io · key from .env · sandbox
  org clinica · key k_4f2a1d9c66b30e17 · sandbox · ana-macbook · production: yes
  a person's key: the sandbox without --prod, production with it
```

## `mcp`

```
pinecall mcp
pinecall mcp install [--list | --remove]
```

```console
$ pinecall mcp install --list
assistants on this machine:
  Claude Code     registered      /Users/berna/.claude.json
  Claude Desktop  registered      /Users/berna/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json
  Codex           registered      /Users/berna/.codex/config.toml
  Cursor          not installed   /Users/berna/.cursor/mcp.json
```

With nothing after it, the MCP server on stdin and stdout, for an assistant to launch. Its tools
sign this machine in, link a project and write a new one; they act in the sandbox, and in
production when a tool is asked with `prod: true` — the org's switch still decides. It starts no
process of its own, and no answer
carries a key. `install` writes `npx -y pinecall@latest mcp` into every assistant installed here, copying
each file to `.bak` first and leaving every other entry and comment as it was; `--list` changes
nothing, `--remove` takes it out. Every tool, and every assistant's file:
[the-mcp.md](the-mcp.md).

---

# What it remembers, and what it knows

## `docs`

```
pinecall docs push [dir] [--base <name>] [--agent <name>] [--file agent.tsx]
pinecall docs list
pinecall docs drop <base>
pinecall docs eval [docs.json] [--base <name>] [--k <n>] [--agent <name>] [--file agent.tsx]
pinecall docs attach <base> [--k <n>] [--mode retrieved|tool] [--min-score <x>] [--agent <slug>] [--team]
pinecall docs detach <base> [--agent <slug>] [--team]
pinecall docs attached
                                        … and any of them with --prod, in production
```

**The documents a turn searches** — the RAG, and only that. `push` reads every `*.md` under the
directory — a local `docs/<name>/` of the agent when none is named, never tracked by the
repository — and sends the folder **whole** to
`PUT /v1/knowledge/<base>`: the base is replaced, never merged, so a push after documents were
added in the console's Knowledge ▸ Docs takes them out. It starts a base; the console keeps it. At a project's root with nothing
typed, `push` and `eval` act on every agent that has documents or a golden, and name the rest. The
base is the agent's slug unless `--base` says otherwise. What the agent knows *by heart* is not a
document and is never pushed: it is [`pinecall agent knowledge`](#agent-knowledge).

**The base you push is the environment's the command runs in.** A push from a laptop replaces the sandbox
base — what your own `pinecall start` answers from — and never the one the telephone answers from.
Production's is the same push with `--prod`, made in the release step of a deploy like a migration,
by the server's token or by a person whose switch is on ([production.md](https://github.com/pinecall/agents/blob/main/docs/production.md)). `list`
and `drop` read the same environment.

```console
$ pinecall docs push
clinica-norte · 7 files · 41 chunks · 812 ms      # base · sent · became · took
```

**`attach` says an agent reads a base.** It is one field of the agent's settings (`bases`),
written as the next version of the corner — yours, the team's with `--team`, production's with
`--prod` — with how a turn reads it: `--k` chunks, `--mode` (`retrieved`: the platform searches
before the turn and hands the model what it found; `tool`: the model decides when to search),
`--min-score`. A base attached twice is replaced, not doubled. `detach` takes it out, and taking
the last one out leaves an empty list rather than no field at all: this corner reads no base, and
the agent does not fall back to the team's. `attached` prints which agents read which base in the
environment asked.

```console
$ pinecall docs attach clinica-norte --k 4
clinica-norte · clinica-norte attached · your corner v4
$ pinecall docs attached
clinica-norte · read by clinica-norte
```

**Several bases are one search, not several.** An agent that reads three collections has them
searched together on every turn — one query, one ranking over all of them — so a collection with
nothing to say about the question takes none of the turn's chunks. `--k` is how many chunks the
turn is handed (the most generous of the attachments), and `--min-score` is read against the base
that set it. The log's `docs.sources` names the base each chunk came from.

The class reaches the base from inside a tool, and nowhere else: `await
this.knowledge.search("horarios", { k: 3 })` asks the gateway for the best chunks of the bases the
environment attached, for these words ([writing-an-agent.md](https://github.com/pinecall/agents/blob/main/docs/writing-an-agent.md)). Which base is the
environment's to say, so a class that searches and registers in an environment where nothing is attached is
refused at registration: `clinica-norte searches its bases, and none is attached to it in sandbox:
pinecall docs attach <base> --agent clinica-norte`. A base attached and never pushed is refused
the same way, naming `pinecall docs push`.

`eval` asks the base every question of a golden — `test/<name>/goldens/docs.json`, a JSON list of
`{asks, expects}`, where `expects` is the heading path the answer should carry — and prints
`recall@k` and `nDCG@10`, computed by code with **no model in the loop**, plus every question it
missed and what came back instead. **With no `--k` it asks with the k this agent reads that base
with** — the attachment's, in this corner — because a golden asks what a turn gets: a base
attached with `--k 4` measured at the endpoint's default of eight answers a question nobody's calls
are asking. Exits 1 when anything missed, so CI can hold a base to it. A
golden is fixed and the index is the variable: never soften a question so a change can pass.

## `memory`

```

nothing remembered about +34600000001
```

Everything memory kept about one contact — the caller's number, or the id the app named — with the
current facts first and the ones a later call superseded dimmed, with the date they stopped
holding. `forget` erases all of it, the right to be forgotten; on a terminal it asks once, and
prints how many facts went. With nobody at a terminal — a script, CI — it erases only with
`--yes`, as `data erase` does, and exits 2 without it; `--yes` also skips the question.

`policy` alone prints what the agent remembers and forgets, corner by corner; with flags it writes
yours (`--team` the team's). Each category is its own flag — `--remember allergies --remember
'preferred name'` — and the policy written replaces the one before it. To take yours out so the
team's holds again: `pinecall agent clear memory`.

`eval` holds **recall** to a golden of `{holds, asks, expects}` — `test/<name>/goldens/memory.json`:
each question brings its own facts, so no
contact of yours is read or written — they go to a scratch contact and are deleted again.

## `remember`

```
pinecall remember [paths] [--agent <name>] [--file agent.tsx] [--grep x] [--json]
```

```console
$ pinecall remember
clinica-norte · anthropic/claude-haiku-5-5 · 3 cases · 3 held · 5445 ms
  ✓ anota la alergia y nunca la tarjeta
  ✓ la mañana sustituye a la tarde, no convive con ella
  ✓ ni guarda un permiso ni borra lo que nadie desmintió
```

The cases are `test/<name>/memory/`, one file per call written down.

The other half of memory: the **write** side. A case is one call written down — both speakers,
because nothing is re-run — the facts memory already holds, and what must come of it: which
categories got a fact, which never did, which values must not survive in any fact's text, and
which held facts the call contradicted.

Each case costs ONE model call, the very one a hang-up makes, run by the gateway against the class
this terminal is holding. Every answer is judged by code: a category is the class's own word, a
value is a literal, a supersession is an id — never one sentence compared to another, because two
ways of writing one fact are one fact.

## `deploy`

```console
~/acme-support $ pinecall deploy --prod --note "reads the order's eta back"
acme-support: release 4 sent · 38 KB · 3b507661b052
acme-support: the box installs and starts it; the release before keeps answering meanwhile
acme-support: release 4 is live
```

The platform runs the project for you: the same `pinecall start` you would run on a server
([production.md](https://github.com/pinecall/agents/blob/main/docs/production.md), "(c)"), in a container of its own on Pinecall's machines, with
nothing to keep up. **The whole guide — preparing a project, secrets, limits, CI, every refusal —
is [deploying.md](deploying.md)**; what follows is the verb's reference. What it takes:

- **The project, packed.** Every file the project's `.gitignore` files leave in — each read where it
  sits, with no git asked, so a folder that is no checkout packs the same — and never
  `node_modules`, `.git`, `dist` or any `.env`: the key in `.env` is yours, and the app gets one of
  its own. 10 MB packed at most, 100 MB unpacked, 5 000 files; a link or a path out of the folder is
  refused.
- **A lockfile, and `@pinecall/agents` in the dependencies.** The platform installs from
  `pnpm-lock.yaml` (`pnpm install --frozen-lockfile --prod`), else `package-lock.json` (`npm ci`),
  else `package.json`, in five minutes at most; the version of `@pinecall/agents` the lockfile pins
  is the one that serves the agent, started by the platform's own `pinecall`.
- **The app's name**: this folder's name, or `--name`. Lower-case words and dashes. The first
  upload makes the app — counted against the org's `hosted_apps` quota in that environment, and given a
  server's token of its own (`hosted app <name>` in the console's Tokens); every later upload is its
  next release, numbered, never edited.

Then the platform installs the release, starts `pinecall start` (`--prod` in production) with the org's
[secrets](#secrets), its token and the gateway's address in the environment, and the verb follows
it: **live** once the release's agents have registered, which is when the release before is told to
drain — so a deploy cuts no call. A release that does not install, exits, or registers nothing in
two minutes is **failed**, printed with its last lines, and the release before keeps answering;
the verb exits 1. `--no-follow` returns once the upload is kept.

Every agent under `agents/` runs in the one process, as `pinecall start` holds them at the root.
The sandbox's platform unless `--prod`; each environment hosts its own apps.

| | |
|---|---|
| `pinecall deploy list` | every app of the org in the environment: `live: release 3`, a release on its way, or the one that failed and why |
| `pinecall deploy releases` | one app's releases, newest first: when, how big, who, and the note |
| `pinecall deploy rollback <n>` | release n's sources kept again as the next release, on the platform itself, and followed like any |
| `pinecall deploy logs [--follow]` | the last lines of the app's process, fresh: asking is what makes the platform send them, a beat or two later, so the verb waits up to fifteen seconds for lines read after it asked (older ones are printed with how old they are). `--follow` keeps printing the lines that come, until Ctrl-C |
| `pinecall deploy stop` · `start` | stopped, its process drains and nothing runs — its releases and token stay, and `list` says `stopped`; started, its newest release runs again |
| `pinecall deploy rm` | the app no longer hosted: its releases go and its token is revoked |

The process prints no console link: a hosted app's output is a log, and a one-use code in a log is
a way in for whoever reads it (see [`start`](#start)).

## `secrets`

```console
$ printf %s "$CRM_TOKEN" | pinecall secrets set CRM_TOKEN --prod
CRM_TOKEN kept · the org's hosted apps here start again with it
$ pinecall secrets --prod
CRM_TOKEN   2026-09-30 13:22  m_ana
```

What the org's hosted apps are started with, as environment variables: the org's, per environment, so
every app `deploy` put there starts with all of them. A name is an environment variable's
(`CRM_TOKEN`), never one starting with `PINECALL_` — the platform sets `PINECALL_KEY` and `PINECALL_URL`
itself. The value is typed without echo, or piped; it never goes on the command line, where the
shell would keep it. The gateway keeps it sealed and **nothing reads it back**: `list` shows names,
who set each and when. Setting or dropping one starts every app of the org in that environment again,
the old process answering until the new one registers. `rm <NAME>` drops one.

## `telemetry`

```console
$ printf %s "$DD_API_KEY" | pinecall telemetry set https://otlp.datadoghq.eu/v1/traces --header dd-api-key
traces go to https://otlp.datadoghq.eu/v1/traces · headers dd-api-key
$ pinecall telemetry
traces go to https://otlp.datadoghq.eu/v1/traces · headers dd-api-key · words stripped
```

Where this org sends a copy of its calls' traces: an OpenTelemetry collector of its own —
Langfuse, Datadog, Grafana, or one you run. Off until set; the console's call page, Observability,
judges and monitors read the call's log, never this. Every spoken call's spans go there over OTLP
(a chat has no worker and so no spans): the model's requests (`gen_ai.*`: provider, model, tokens, time
to first token), speech in and out, every tool the agent ran, each span carrying `pinecall.org`,
`pinecall.env`, `pinecall.agent` and `pinecall.call`, so one call is one trace in your tool.
`set` takes the URL on the command line and each header's **value** from stdin, one per
`--header`, in the order named — typed without echo on a terminal, or piped one line per header —
never from a flag. `--pii` lets a span carry what was said and what a tool got; without it the
words are stripped before export and the timings, tokens and names stay. The gateway keeps the
headers sealed and never reads them back: the bare verb prints the URL and the headers' names.
`clear` stops the export; the calls' logs stay on Pinecall either way. Langfuse takes two headers,
piped one line each: [Export traces](https://docs.pinecall.io/guides/export-traces/).

## `monitors`

```console
$ pinecall monitors add "slow answers" --metric e2e_median_s --above 2 --days 7
mon_3f9a1c2b4d5e · slow answers · e2e_median_s above 2 over 7 days · every agent
$ pinecall monitors add "judges slipping" --metric held_rate --below 0.9 --agent front-desk
mon_8b1d2e3f4a5c · judges slipping · held_rate below 0.9 over 7 days · front-desk
$ pinecall monitors
mon_3f9a1c2b4d5e  slow answers     e2e_median_s above 2 over 7 days   every agent  fired 2026-10-08 at 2.41
mon_8b1d2e3f4a5c  judges slipping  held_rate below 0.9 over 7 days    front-desk   never fired
$ pinecall monitors rm mon_8b1d2e3f4a5c
mon_8b1d2e3f4a5c forgotten
```

The numbers this org watches, and the line each must not cross. A monitor reads one number of
the observability series — the same the console's Observability screen draws — over a window of
1, 7 or 30 days (`--days`, 7 when left out), for every agent or one (`--agent`), and fires the
first time a call's seal finds it on the wrong side of the line: once a day, as `monitor.fired`
on the agent's log, where the console's Monitors screen and `sessions` show it with the day and
the value that crossed. `--above` fires over the line, `--below` under it.

| metric | what it is |
|---|---|
| `e2e_median_s` | the caller's wait from their last word to the agent's first, median, in seconds |
| `llm_median_s` | the model's time to its first token, median, in seconds |
| `held_rate` | the share of the judges' verdicts that held, 0 to 1 — a floor, `--below` |
| `escalated_rate` | the share of calls a person took over, 0 to 1 |
| `tool_failure_rate` | the share of tool calls that failed, 0 to 1 |
| `spend_usd` | what the calls cost, in dollars |
| `calls` | how many calls there were |

`rm <id>` forgets one. The list is the world's: `--prod` for production's monitors.

## `webhook`

```console
$ printf %s "$WEBHOOK_SECRET" | pinecall webhook set https://hooks.example.com/pinecall --secret
alerts go to https://hooks.example.com/pinecall · signed
$ pinecall webhook test
the URL took it: a signed webhook.test post answered 2xx
$ pinecall webhook
alerts go to https://hooks.example.com/pinecall · signed
```

Where this org's alerts are posted beyond the agent's log: a URL of your own — Slack, PagerDuty,
your backend. Every alert — a monitor that fired (`monitor.fired`), today's spend three times
the usual (`spend.unusual`), a quota that ran out (`credits.exhausted`) — is posted as it is
written, as JSON `{type, org, env, agent, at, data}` with `x-pinecall-event` naming the type,
tried twice within five seconds; a URL that fails is logged and the log keeps the alert. `set`
takes the URL on the command line and, with `--secret`, the secret from stdin — typed without echo
on a terminal, or piped — never from a flag; with a secret every post carries
`x-pinecall-signature: sha256=<HMAC-SHA256 of the body>`. The gateway keeps the secret sealed and
never reads it back: the bare verb prints the URL and whether posts are signed. `test` posts one
`webhook.test` event, signed the same way, and exits 1 if the URL did not answer 2xx. `clear`
stops the posting. What the console's bell tells each person is their own choice, under
Notifications; the webhook is the org's. [Alerts](../../docs/pages/guides/alerts.md) has a
verification snippet per language.

## Exit codes

| | |
|---|---|
| `0` | it did what it says |
| `1` | the thing being measured did not hold: a golden broke, a check failed, a judge answered broken, a drift fell past the threshold — or the gateway refused, in its own words |
| `2` | this command cannot run: no key, a flag that is not a flag, a persona nobody wrote, a verb that moved (`pipeline set` is `agent set` now) |

A call **nobody judged** is not a pass: `simulate --judge` exits non-zero for it, because "nobody
looked at this" must never open a gate.

## What each verb knocks at

The bridge between this document and the gateway API. Anything in the right-hand column, your own
code can call — over HTTP, in any language, with the same key.

| verb | endpoints |
|---|---|
| `start` | `WS /v1/apps` twice: the agent's serve entry, a process it starts, and its own companion socket (`answers_dev`); `GET /v1/agents/{slug}/config` for the tools on the connected line |
| `chat` · `test` · `simulate` · `remember` · `personas try` | `WS /v1/apps` from the agent's serve entry, a process the verb starts and stops |
| `start`, once connected | `POST /v1/login/codes` (the console's URL, at the instance it registered at), `PUT /v1/line/from` (the kept phone, on every connect in the sandbox), `GET /v1/routes` (the endpoints it answers at), `GET /v1/agents/{slug}/line` (when one of them is a number) |
| `chat` | `WS /v1/chat?agent=&app=&contact=` |
| `start --events` · `sessions` · `supervise` | `GET /v1/calls/{call}/events` (SSE), `GET /v1/agents/{slug}/sessions` |
| `sessions <call>` · `supervise` | `GET /v1/calls/{call}/state` — asked FIRST, because it is the one endpoint that 404s for a call this gateway has no log of |
| `supervise` | `POST /v1/calls/{call}/verbs` — with the **org key**: a desk that only reads and types needs no seat. A seat (`POST …/supervise`) is for audio, and that is the console's |
| `simulate --listen` | `POST /v1/calls/{call}/listen`, then the LiveKit room |
| `simulate --voice` · `test --voice` | `POST /v1/evals/voice`, `POST /v1/evals/caller` |
| `test` · `runs` | `POST /v1/evals/run`, `GET /v1/evals/runs[/{id}]`; `runs promote` is `GET /v1/calls/{call}/golden?name=&from_seq=` |
| `cases` | `GET /v1/evals/cases?agent=&status=` (a case is found by its name there), `PATCH`·`DELETE /v1/evals/cases/{id}`, `POST /v1/evals/cases` |
| `runs drift` | `GET /v1/agents/{slug}/sessions` — a held-rate is counted off the verdicts the calls already carry, so it asks the sessions endpoint and no evals endpoint at all |
| `eval` | `POST /v1/evals/replay/{call}` |
| `agent` | `GET`·`PUT /v1/agents/{slug}/settings`, `GET …/settings/history`, `GET …/settings/diff`, `POST …/settings/rollback`; `list` and `stop` are `GET /v1/apps` and `POST /v1/apps/{app}/stop` |
| `agent knowledge` · `lexicon` · `memory policy` · `docs attach` · `detach` | `GET`·`PUT /v1/agents/{slug}/settings` · `GET`·`PUT /v1/agents/{slug}/lexicon`, `GET …/history` |
| `pipeline` | `GET /v1/agents/{slug}/pipeline` |
| `docs` | `PUT`·`GET`·`DELETE /v1/knowledge[/{base}]`, `POST /v1/knowledge/{base}/eval`, `GET /v1/knowledge/attached` |
| `memory` | `GET`·`DELETE /v1/contacts/{contact}/memory`, `POST /v1/contacts/memory/eval` |
| `remember` | `POST /v1/agents/{slug}/memory/extraction` |
| `numbers` | `GET`·`POST /v1/numbers`, `DELETE /v1/numbers/{number}` |
| `carriers` | `GET /v1/carriers`, `GET`·`PUT`·`DELETE /v1/carrier[?account=]` |
| `providers` | `GET /v1/providers` · `PUT`·`DELETE`·`GET /v1/provider-keys[/{vendor}]` |
| `voices` | `GET /v1/voices` · `POST /v1/voices/sample` |
| `callbacks` | `GET /v1/callbacks[?agent=&after=]` |
| `personas` | `GET /v1/agents/{slug}/personas` · `PUT`·`DELETE /v1/agents/{slug}/personas/{name}` — and `push` reads the agent's remaining files before sending them |
| `judges` | `GET /v1/agents/{slug}/judges` · `PUT`·`DELETE /v1/agents/{slug}/judges/{name}` |
| `line` | `GET`·`POST`·`DELETE /v1/agents/{slug}/line`, `PUT`·`DELETE /v1/line/from` |
| `console` | `POST /v1/login/codes` in the environment asked — the one-use code the browser spends for a key of its own. Every other endpoint the console asks, it asks for itself |
| `login` | `POST /v1/login/pairings`, `GET …/{code}/key` — then `GET /v1/whoami` to prove what it got |
| `link` | what `login` knocks at when the machine is not signed in, then `GET /v1/login/orgs` for the person's orgs and `POST /v1/login/org` for the key in the one picked |
| `whoami` | `GET /v1/whoami` in the environment asked — the sandbox, or production with `--prod` |
| `deploy` | `POST /v1/hosted/{name}/releases` (the tarball itself, `application/gzip`), then `GET /v1/hosted` every few seconds while it follows; `list` is `GET /v1/hosted`, `releases` `GET …/{name}/releases`, `rollback <n>` `POST …/{name}/rollback {release}`, `logs` `GET …/{name}/logs` every two seconds, `stop` · `start` `POST …/{name}/stop` · `…/start`, `rm` `DELETE /v1/hosted/{name}` |
| `secrets` | `GET /v1/secrets` · `PUT`·`DELETE /v1/secrets/{name}` |
| `telemetry` | `GET`·`PUT`·`DELETE /v1/telemetry` |
| `monitors` | `GET`·`POST /v1/monitors` · `DELETE /v1/monitors/{id}` |
| `webhook` | `GET`·`PUT`·`DELETE /v1/webhook` · `POST /v1/webhook/test` |
| every verb, without `--prod` | its own endpoints at `PINECALL_URL`, with the project's key and `pinecall-env: sandbox` on each request and socket; nothing is asked first |
| every verb, with `--prod` | the same endpoints at `PINECALL_URL`, with the same key and `pinecall-env: production` on each request and socket |
| `prompt` | none. It is the one verb that needs no gateway and no key |
